For example, we can ask ourselves, how do you shuffle cards? It’s something that is really hard to describe. But once you see it, and you can observe other people doing it, it’s pretty easy to understand what’s going on. But to really know how to shuffle cards, we have to ask ourselves, what items do we need? What tools do we need? Do we need any skills and do any prior knowledge for example, we need to know what a deck of cards is, we need to know what shuffling means we need to know how to manipulate the cards in such a way that they will become shuffled. And of course, even then, the terminology we use is still very difficult. In years past, when I’ve asked students how to shuffle cards, they’ll usually tell me something like cut the deck and then hold them up like this and then ruffle the cards together and it will work. But of course, if you don’t know that cutting the deck means separating the top half from the bottom half and not taking a pair of scissors and cutting them in half.

If you think about it, cryptography is very important today with the rise of the Internet and modern technology. Any data that’s transmitted over the internet can be intercepted by just about anyone from your internet service provider all the way to the website that you’re communicating with, and anybody in between. Remember, the internet is built upon open standards, and so anybody can understand the packet formats and deconstruct them very quickly. So we need a way that we can encrypt and secure the data inside of those packets. So they can only be opened by the intended recipients, and that’s where the field of cryptography comes in. There were lots of historical Computer Science professionals interested in cryptography. Charles Babbage was very fascinated by it. Alan Turing was especially involved in cryptography, and Claude Shannon, were all involved in the field of cryptography. Also, surprisingly, the author Edgar Allan Poe was one of the people that was really excited about cryptography outside of computer scientists, and in fact, helped popularize cryptography as a word game that you might see in your newspaper.",modified:"2026-01-06T13:02:51-06:00",tags:[],title:"Introduction",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/16-cryptography/01-intro/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Cybersecurity",description:"Resources Slides Video Script In this module, we’re going to discuss a lot of topics related to cyber security.

First, we’re going to talk about in compression. What do you think compression is and why do you think it’s useful? As you might recall, compression is reducing the amount of space a particular piece of data needs to be stored on a computer. And if we think about that, that may not even really make sense, how can we take the piece of data and store it in fewer Bits and Bytes than what it originally was? It turns out, there are a lot of different ways to do that.

And compared to your average laptop, the laptop is the teeny mouse, so it’s about two big things. And it’s about size, because many problems just can’t fit into a standard laptop or standard desktop. And see if this issue of Okay, my problem is too big for that, what do I do? You take it to a supercomputer. Or similarly, if you’ve got a big problem that just takes way too long, or you got a little problem, and you get lots and lots of them, then it’s really useful to have something that isn’t likely to go ahead and say, Oh, yeah, by the way, I’m going to restart it every couple weeks, because Microsoft pushed out a patch, or something like that.

And so you can see them here moving actually the wires from different plug boards for the computer to actually make different calculations and operations work. So the task was made even more difficult by the secrecy involved with the machine. Initially, programmers weren’t even able to see the schematics of the machine and had to pass their wiring instructions belong to the technicians. So the programmers didn’t weren’t even instructed on how the actual machine was built or how it worked. And they couldn’t even actually run their program themselves.

The first version of HTML that Sir Tim Berners-Lee released in 1990, was still a huge improvement over the content that was being served on the Internet at that time. We really had no unify language that we were able to use to distribute information on the web. HTML 1.0 brought that to light. Even though throughout the 90s, HTML was a pretty static language, meaning that our webpages were still pretty straightforward, there really wasn’t a whole lot of dynamic content. It wasn’t until Web 4.0 released and the late 90s and even into the early 2000s, where we started to make the transition to the Web 2.0 era, where we started to see a lot more social media type content, and very dynamic content being hosted on the web, like a lot of media as well.

It was discovered in 1900 off the coast of a Greek island called Antikythera and really is puzzled scientists for quite some time. It was believed to have originated around 100 BCE, but little was known about its origin. But however, from the detailed gears and inscriptions on the piece itself, we can actually deduce what it is actually used for. As you learned in the video, the Antikythera mechanism was an early computer used to calculate the position of the sun, moon and planets in the sky, as well as important dates and eclipses.

We have to take a look at how we as humans can communicate with a physical or inanimate object: a computer. In order for us to tell computers what to do, we had to develop a language that we could use to communicate with it. Here on my slide I have on the left a bunch of different ways on how to say good morning, in various human languages that we use to communicate with with one another. And on the right side here we have a bunch of computer languages that we have. So the first one up here is happens to be Python 2, Python 3, C, Java, JavaScript, and even Rust.

But how did we make the leap from Boolean logic on electrical circuits to the modern computers that we have today, and we’ll talk a little bit about that gap here today, but there will still be some missing parts that we’ll talk about later. But this brings us to Herman Hollerith, who at the time was a United States Census office employee, and he was tasked with coming up with a better way to calculate the census result. Because at the time, calculating the US census was incredibly slow. The 1880 census alone took eight years to tabulate, which really kind of defeats the purpose of a census, right?

A person who’s smart or has an high IQ is capable of doing math, really good at remembering information, and creation of information. But it’s not necessarily intelligent behavior. So intelligence involves a lot of different things, including reasoning and problem solving, which of course, smart people are able to do those things as well. Our ability to reason to a certain degree and problem solved to a certain degree is definitely an intelligent behavior. When you encounter a situation in you’re environment, and you reason and solve that particular problem to get around that particular obstacle.

Now that we know how to store data in a reasonable fashion, we have to talk about where most of the data in the world is actually stored. And for that, really is just the internet. So at the highest level, right, we can think of the internet as a very big, very big, completely unstructured database of all of the information in the world, right, because pretty much almost everything is connected to the internet anymore. Not everything, but pretty much. Some parts of it are very structured, and very well formed and easily searchable. But generally, it will never be as well structured as we’d like.

However, we are pretty much constantly using tools like Google to find information and the vast amount of data that is out there on the web, and it does a pretty good job, doesn’t it? When you do a Google search most of the time you find what you’re looking for. So how do we go about finding information in a big giant unstructured pile of data that really is pretty much like finding a needle in a haystack, as far as Internet is concerned. So that task is the job of information retrieval specialist, and the algorithms and research they do. In a base form, right, let’s say we want to find some information on a very simple Internet, maybe this is back in the early early, early days, where there was pretty much nothing out there.",modified:"2024-06-27T12:25:42-05:00",tags:[],title:"Searching the Web",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/19-search-info/02-searching-web/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Cybersecurity",description:"Resources Slides Video Script So finally, let’s talk about storing passwords securely in your applications. And there are a lot of different ways you can store passwords so that users could use them to authenticate. Let’s take a look at that. First, obviously, we could store the password itself. The user types in a password, we store that password in the database. Great, right? They type that password in again, we check it to make sure they typed in the same password. If they did, they let them in. That sounds like a really great system, doesn’t it? Hopefully, you’re cringing a little bit thinking about this. Because obviously, websites that have databases on them get hacked all the time. And if a hacker gets access to this database, they have your password. Simple as that. There’s nothing that they have to do, there’s no decryption they have to worry about, they get your password. And of course, one of the weaknesses of people on the internet is we tend to use the same password over and over again. Raise your hand, if you do that. I do. I use the same password a lot of places on the internet, it’s something I probably shouldn’t do. But I do. And so if somebody gets one of my passwords, they might be able to use that password to log into other websites that I use that same password on. So this is obviously not very secure. And the only thing that they need to compromise this is database access. As soon as they access the database, they have all the passwords, and it’s really simple so we probably shouldn’t do this.",modified:"2026-01-06T13:02:51-06:00",tags:[],title:"Storing Passwords",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/17-cybersecurity/02-storing-passwords/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Compression & Error Checking",description:"Resources Slides Video Script Next, let’s take a look at another form of compression called Huffman coding.

Now, some tags may also actually have attributes in between there, but we’ll get to that later. To make a basic web page, we need four primary tags, HTML, head, and body. But we’ll also add in title there, so we can actually have a name for our webpage as well. The HTML tag primarily wraps the entire contents of the web page, although not all of those contents are actually displayed directly on the web page. For example, the head tag will actually have some meta information about the page, but it’s not actually rendered in the web browser, the title tag actually belongs to the head tag. And while it’s not rendered on the page, it’s actually going to denote the name of the webpage in things like your tabs. So when you open up a page in a new tab, and you have the name of the webpage, there, that’s where that comes from.

A good definition for an algorithm is a finite list of specific instructions for carrying out a procedure or solving a problem.

It’s giving the computer a list of very specific instructions that we’d like it to carry out so that it can perform a task or solve a problem for us. So let’s look at an example of what an algorithm looks like. One of the most common algorithms used today is Euclid’s algorithm. Euclid was a Greek mathematician from 300 B.C, and his algorithm was developed to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. That greatest common divisor if you studied algebra is used to reduce fractions. And even today in our computers and calculators. We use a modified version of this algorithm to do exactly this task.

So if we assume that we are two facts here, A and B are both true. So let’s say this inner circle here, this left circle here represents a and this right circle here represents B and the square on the outside represents everything else. So when a and b are not, so if A and B are both true, then the statement evaluates to true. So the left hand side and the right hand side of the operator both must be true in order for the whole statement to be true. If A is false, or B is true. false, then the whole thing would be false. Now if we introduce a third fact, see, we kind of get the same results, right. So similar kind of story with the Venn diagram. Here we have a, b, and c.

Similarly, Augustus DeMorgan came up with a way to deal with the negation of entire Boolean logic statements. So this becomes very similar to how you multiply a statement or a regular mathematical statement by a negative one. I guess system marking came up with a way to deal with the negation of entire Boolean logic statements. The DeMorgan’s theorem essentially states to treat the NOT operator like the negative sign so you’re going to apply the negative to each of the premises or facts and then swap the operators or basically and become or’s and or’s become hands. So let’s take a look at an example. So if we invert our particular statement here where we have a and b, right, so A and B, not a and b becomes not a or not B, so we negated or applied the knot to a and the knots to b and the knot and becomes or similar idea for or not a or b becomes not a, and not B.",modified:"2024-06-27T12:25:42-05:00",tags:[],title:"Boolean Algebra",uri:"/cs-zero/i-concepts/03-bits-and-boolean-algebra/03-algebra/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Big Data",description:"HealthMap",modified:"2022-07-25T12:35:31-05:00",tags:[],title:"HealthMap.org",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/20-big-data/03-health-map/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Artificial Intelligence",description:"Watch through 5:38",modified:"2022-07-25T12:21:43-05:00",tags:[],title:"John McCarthy (1927-2011): Artificial Intelligence",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/03-john-mcarthy/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Cybersecurity",description:"Resources Slides Video Script Another area of cybersecurity that we should discuss is social engineering. Social engineering is all about using techniques to compromise the system by exploiting the users directly instead of the system security itself. And this is a really important concept. There’s an old saying, in computer science that a system is only as secure as the users that use that system. It’s kind of a play off the idea of a system is only as secure as its weakest link. And in most cases, the weakest link is the user itself. And so on the next few slides, we’re going to take a look at some different ways that you can use social engineering, to maybe break into a computer system and what those things look like so that we can defend against those. So a great example of social engineering is trying to get some information from somebody that they don’t want to give. And a great example of that would be a bank account number. So if I wanted to get someone’s bank account number, how do you think I could go about that using social engineering? Take a minute to think about it. So while this example may not work that well in today’s world, because not many people carry around checkbooks. If you have a checkbook, look at your checkbook at the bottom of your checks, and see what’s printed there. Hopefully, you should realize that printed at the bottom of your checks are two numbers. One of them is the routing number that identifies your bank, and the other number is your bank account number. And so I think one of the best ways to do this was actually discovered by Gru in the movie Despicable Me selling cookies. He had his girls sell Girl Scout cookies, and as long as he said, “Oh, I can only accept checks.” A lot of people might not think twice about writing a check for a Girl Scout troop, but that check includes your bank account information. And so with a little bit more work, you could probably use that information very nefariously against the people that wrote those checks. So even though it’s something that we don’t really think about giving out very often, it’s right there out in the open if we know how to get it.",modified:"2026-01-06T13:02:51-06:00",tags:[],title:"Social Engineering",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/17-cybersecurity/03-social-engineering/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Search and Information Retrieval",description:"",modified:"2022-07-25T12:35:31-05:00",tags:[],title:"The Internet: How Search Works",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/19-search-info/03-how-search/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Graphics and Video Games",description:`Watch this trailer for “Tin Toy” for a precursor to the uncanny valley.

When you were a kid, if you played with radios or walkie talkies, or anything like that, you might have had trouble understanding what other people say, Heck, even it happens today, sometimes on cell phone calls. So if there was a way that we could confirm that the data we’re receiving is the data that was actually sent without adding too much overhead to the data, that might be a really powerful tool, a great intuition to think of is squeezing the data into a smaller space, and then using that to check and see if we got the right answer.",modified:"2026-01-06T13:02:51-06:00",tags:[],title:"Error Checking - Pinpoint",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/03-pinpoint/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"The Internet > Web Programming",description:"Resources Slides Video Script So we talked briefly about CSS or Cascading Style Sheets before when we introduced html 4.0.

And each of those algorithms have unique characteristics that make them suitable for certain types of data in certain situations. To really explore sorting algorithms, we’re going to perform these sorting algorithms using a deck of cards. So if you have access to a deck of cards, I encourage you to go find one and take out maybe 8 or 10 cards in a certain order. I have the cards Ace through 10 here, and you’ll be able to follow along with our examples on these next few videos. Before we get started, I’d like you to take the cards that you have selected, shuffled them up a little bit, and then lay them out in front of you and try and sort them in order from smallest to largest. And while you do that, I’d like you to think in your mind about the exact steps that you’re following. For example, are you looking for the smallest card and moving it to one side, or looking for the largest card and moving it to the other side? Or are you trying to arrange little bits of it at a time and slowly put those pieces together until they form the full sort of deck of cards, it might be really interesting to see how the method that you naturally follow matches up with one of these algorithms that we’re going to take a look at.

And so as we saw in the video with the Enigma machine, you would set the rotors to a particular key. And then when you press the key on the keyboard, and electrical current would go from that key, through the plug board, through the rotors, back out through the rotors, and then light up a lamp above.

So looking at this diagram, can you see some advantages to this network setup. For example, if one node goes down, can we still find a way to get a message to all the other nodes, it looks like we can in a lot of cases. So that makes this network very fault tolerance. In addition, if we want to add more computers to the network, we just have to plug them in at one of these open spots and they’ll be able to communicate as well. So packet switch network is really important. One of the key concepts in packet switch networking is routing. And routing is figuring out a way to create a path in the network to get from point A to point B using the shortest path which means Be the fewest number of hops, it really depends.

So the document object model is really how a web page is actually structured. So you can kind of think of the window here as like a tab in your web browser.

So Alan Newell and Herbert Simon were a couple of early researchers in AI. In 1955, they wrote a program designed to mimic the problem solving skills of a human being, and called it the logic theorist. This program is now widely considered to be the first AI program, it was used to prove theorems in the book of Principia Mathematica, and actually created a much more elegant proof for some of the theorems than the author wrote for the book. At the time, interest was swirling around the growing idea of AI, and the experts decided to come together and discuss that topic at length. This is a conference that John McCarthy had wanted and successfully organized. There’s a lot of different types of AI that have been developed over the years. And there’s a lot of different methodologies behind them to make them artificially intelligent. But a lot of this deals with how we represent knowledge and information for the AI. So there’s a ton of information in the world, even something as simple as a smartwatch that’s detecting your heart rate and oxygen levels and things like that. It ends up being a lot of information over the course of a small period. And so how do we represent that knowledge in order for our AI to actually be able to consume it and make good rational decisions from it.",modified:"2026-01-06T13:02:51-06:00",tags:[],title:"AI Advancements",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/06-ai-advancement/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Cryptography",description:"Resources Slides Video Script The success for cracking the Enigma machine really comes down to the work of this man, Marian Rejewski. Marian Rejewski was a Polish mathematician who worked on the Enigma machine in the early days of the 1920s and 1930s. The Enigma machine was actually originally available as a corporate machine; you could go out and buy it as a corporation, and use it to encrypt and store data. And so it wasn’t until much later that was taken over by the German Nazi Party and used in their war efforts. And so public Enigma machines were available and could be studied. And so Marian Rejewski was able to study some of the early Enigma machines and try and predict the adaptations that Germany made as they move closer to war in the late 1920s and 30s. So based on his work, he was able to determine what the Germans were doing and was even able to eventually replicate some of the German machines that they had created. But of course, that was just part of the story. So to crack the Enigma machine, it was really first cracked by Marian Rejewski of Poland. He was able to use some of those publicly available Enigma machines to crack some of the earliest things that they did. By 1938, as Germany was getting closer to war, they added two new wheels of their own making it much much harder to crack if you didn’t know the wheels existed. And so Marian Rejewski of Poland contacted folks in England and gave them a lot of his research and ask them for assistance. And so by 1939, Alan Turing, working together with the folks at Bletchley Park, created what he called the Bombe, which was a machine that could decrypt the Enigma machine. And so work on the Bombe progressed pretty much throughout the entire war. And by 1945, almost every single message that the German sent using the Enigma machine, could be deciphered by the allies within two days. So what is the Bombe? The Bombe is a machine developed by Alan Turing to simulate hundreds of Enigma machines side by side. You can see that it has all of these sets of three wheels, simulating the three wheels that might be present in an Enigma machine. And it was designed to explore many of the weaknesses and other facts about the Enigma machine that were known to the Allies based on the work of Marian Rejewski and Alan Turing at that particular time.

In this video we’re gonna be looking at JavaScript. But let’s look into some of the history behind it. To start, we’re going to talk about Brendan Eich. Brendan Eich was actually one of the people who co founded the Mozilla project to of course launching the major browser Firefox, but he’s also the creator of JavaScript. Eich had a master’s degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, but then he started working at Silicon Graphics, working about seven years or so on an operating systems project, and primarily a lot of networking code. But he then started at Netscape in 1995. And when he joined Netscape, he really intended to put the language called scheme into the web browsers. Now, Netscape, of course is no longer prevalent in today’s internet world, but Netscape was really primarily one of the leading internet companies back in the mid to late 90s. But as Brendan started to work and putting scheme into the web browser, Netscape noted that his project actually resembled the Java syntax, and pushed really quickly after after that point. His project released a little over a week later, to accommodate Netscape Navigator 2. And so he was really pushed really time pressed underneath, and a lot of pressure to get this language actually released. And it actually underwent many different name changes during that time. One point it was called mocha, then LiveScript, and then eventually called JavaScript all in the same month. While it does resemble Java, JavaScript itself is actually an entirely different category of programming language. While Java is very object oriented JavaScript is more of a as as it sounds, right, more of a scripting programming language designed specifically for the web.",modified:"2024-06-27T12:25:42-05:00",tags:[],title:"Javascript",uri:"/cs-zero/ii-internet/13-webprog/06-javascript/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"The Internet > The History of the Internet",description:"Resources Slides Video Script J.

In fact, Merge Sort was actually written way back in the 1950s and 60s to allow us the ability to sort data that didn’t even fit on a single data storage media at the time. So for example, with merge sort, we could sort the data on three different disks full of data very independently and very efficiently. The process for merge sort is pretty simple. We start by taking our data and splitting it in half, and we keep repeatedly splitting it in half until we get down to one or two items. Then we make sure those items are in order, and then we will merge those two items together all the way down until we get to our final results. So let’s take a look at how we can perform Merge Sort using our deck of cards. The next sorting algorithm we’ll look at is merge sorts. Remember that merge sort is a divided conquer algorithm.

And it allowed for a synchronous JavaScript. So really what happens with Ajax is once the web page loads, the JavaScript can run on the webpage. But what if you wanted more data from your web server? Well, typically, what would end up happening is that you would have to have the page refreshed in its entirety in order to get that web request fulfilled. But Ajax allows you to send information back and forth to your web server behind the scenes without having to have the whole entire page reload. This isn’t really useful, because we can have the entire page get loaded once, especially if it’s a really large, complicated page. And then your JavaScript can handle sending requests back and forth to your web server to reload certain things. Like for example, new comments that were on the page, a new likes, or even maybe a new reply to a Reddit thread, this drastically decreases the amount of time you spend browsing the web page by having to wait for the entire page to reload, just to see who the latest comment was on your post.

Just to understand how that works. For this example, we’re going to look at the complexity of merge sort. Let’s consider the example where we’re doing merge sort on eight numbers. So here we have the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So the first step of Merge Sort would have us divide those in half into groups, 1,2,3,4, and group 5,6,7,8, then we would divide each of those in half again, ending up with four groups 1-2,3-4,5-6, and 7-8t. So this diagram helps us understand the complexity of this algorithm. And we need to measure two things. We need to measure how many swaps it can make, and then we need to measure how many divisions it makes. So let’s look at swaps first, these are all in the correct order, but we have to assume worst case. So in the worst case, we would make 1,2,3,4 swaps. So we know we need four swaps for one of our numbers. And we need to compare that to the size of the input, which is eight. So how does four compared to eight, an easy way to think of it is four is just our input size eight divided by two. That’s pretty easy. The second step is a little trickier. Because what we need to do is we need to look at how many times we have to divide the numbers to get all the way down to groups of two. And in this case, we have three levels. So we have three here, but how does three compared to eight?",modified:"2025-10-08T15:23:13-05:00",tags:[],title:"Complexity (Part 2)",uri:"/cs-zero/i-concepts/06-algorithms/09-complexity-2/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Concepts > Universal Computers",description:"",modified:"2022-07-18T14:30:23-05:00",tags:[],title:"Modern Turing Machines",uri:"/cs-zero/i-concepts/05-universal-computers/08-modern-turing/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Concepts > Human-Computer Interaction",description:"",modified:"2022-06-02T16:09:02-05:00",tags:[],title:"User Centered Design - Don Norman",uri:"/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/08-user-centered/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Artificial Intelligence",description:"",modified:"2022-07-25T12:21:43-05:00",tags:[],title:"IBM's Watson",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/09-ibm-watson/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Graphics and Video Games",description:"",modified:"2022-07-25T14:24:12-05:00",tags:[],title:"Steve Russell talks about his early video game Spacewar!",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/22-graphics-and-video-games/09-spacewar/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"The Internet > The History of the Internet",description:"",modified:"2022-06-22T14:54:02-05:00",tags:[],title:"Internet History part 4: Vint Cerf on the Birth of the Internet in 1983",uri:"/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/09-vint-cerf/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Cryptography",description:"",modified:"2023-04-13T12:34:20-05:00",tags:[],title:"Public Key Cryptography: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (short version)",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/16-cryptography/09-diffie-hellman/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"The Internet > Web Programming",description:"",modified:"2022-06-22T14:54:02-05:00",tags:[],title:"The Machine is Us/ing Us (Final Version)",uri:"/cs-zero/ii-internet/13-webprog/09-machine-us/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Concepts > Algorithms",description:"Resources Slides Video Script So far in this module, we’ve studied algorithms, and remember that an algorithm is a specific set of steps that we can use to solve a problem. However, what if we’re faced with a problem that we can’t solve? Either because it’s impossible, or because we have so much data that we can’t possibly find the one right answer using an algorithm. In that case, we would use something we call a heuristic. A heuristic is an experience based technique we can use to find a satisfactory solution to a problem, which may or may not be the absolute best solution to that problem. For example, if we have a particular person, and we’d like to know what their height is, we could actually get out a tape measure and measure it. Or we could use a heuristic and say, well, you’re standing next to that door and you look like you’re about six feet tall. That would be an experience based technique or a heuristic to estimate how tall someone is. We of course, use heuristics every day. For example, we use the rule of thumb when Trying to measure things. We can take educated guesses based on our previous experience, we can use our common sense and find answers that seem logical. We can try an answer and see if we can work backwards and prove that that is an answer to the question. Or we can even take our problem and try and do a simpler problem first and use that information to solve our larger problem.",modified:"2025-10-08T15:23:13-05:00",tags:[],title:"Heuristics",uri:"/cs-zero/i-concepts/06-algorithms/10-heuristics/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Concepts > Universal Computers",description:"Resources Slides Video Script Hello everyone in this video we’re going to take a look at a detailed example on how a Turing machine may actually perform a common operation that we would do with a regular program.

But it can simply move left or right one, it can write ones and zeros and it can also read and also jump around in the program as well. So these eight simple steps remember represent a truly universal computer given enough time, and given enough memory, it can perform any operation any other real world computer could actually do. So here’s an example of a basic program on our Turing machine. So our reader or the Turing machine itself would be preloaded with this program.

Resources Slides Video Script Welcome back everyone. In this video, I’m going to talk a little bit about how we can get connected to the CS Linux server. So when we’re working with our webpages, we can actually open up our web page just fine in our local web browser if you’re working on your computer. For this class, we’re going to be hosting our web pages on CS Linux, so we can actually access them throughout the web. Because if we’re just working on our local machines, we’re not going to be able to access that website from anywhere else in the world. In order to achieve this, we’re going to need a tool that allows us to use SSH. The easiest way for Windows is to download something like PuTTY, or MobaXterm. If you decide to download or use PuTTY, you’ll be taken to a website once you actually click the download link on their main page to something that looks like this. Now, the file that you’ll actually need, you can kind of ignore all the alternative binary files down here, all you need is the MSI Windows Installer and pick if you’re using a 32 bit machine or 64 bit machine. Most people are going to be using the 64 bit machine. So that’s how you can download PuTTY. If you do a quick Google search for MobaXterm, you’ll actually find the download for that as well. Both of these are 100% free; although, MobaXterm does have a pro version, which essentially allows you to save more connections than the standard version. But for most people, the standard free version will be just fine. If you’re actually a CS major, I encourage you to download and install MobaXterm over PuTTY, because it can actually be a lot more useful and flexible for you in the future for other classes. But PuTTY will work just fine for those as well.`,modified:"2025-10-17T18:42:05-05:00",tags:[],title:"CIS Linux",uri:"/cs-zero/ii-internet/13-webprog/10-cs-linux/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"The Internet > The History of the Internet",description:"Resources Slides Video Script The technology that Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn developed is the transmission control protocol or TCP. TCP allows small networks to talk to each other using a common standard or protocol that determines how they actually interact. The biggest benefit of TCP is there’s no single point of failure in the system. They’re not all talking to a central hub, each computer can talk point to point or host a host and pass the packets along as needed to the next system. And the other important thing about TCP is computers could also acknowledge successful transmission or if the transmission wasn’t received, but expected it could request to retransmit all of that missing data, making the system very robust against errors.

Resources Slides RSA Calculator Worksheet Video Script Let’s take a look at one modern form of encryption called RSA encryption. RSA was developed in 1977, and it was named for the three creators- Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adelman. RSA encryption uses the product of two large prime numbers to generate a key that’s used to encrypt data, and the strength of the key really depends on the difficulty of factoring that large number back into its two prime numbers. So for example, if we say our key number is 1071. Can we factor that into the two prime numbers? We could do it eventually, but we’d have to check a lot of different numbers to see what it was. So now imagine that 1071, instead of being a number with just four digits, was a number that had 64 digits in it. That’s really the size of the prime number products that we’re talking about when we do RSA encryption. And so really, the key to RSA encryption is the fact that it’s very, very difficult to factor a large number like that into the two unique prime numbers that are used to create it. So let’s take a look at how RSA encryption works to see why that’s important and why it can create a system that is easily broken if that rule doesn’t hold.`,modified:"2026-01-06T13:02:51-06:00",tags:[],title:"RSA Encryption",uri:"/cs-zero/iii-topics/16-cryptography/10-rsa/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"CS Topics > Artificial Intelligence",description:"Resources Slides Video Script So in review, we’ve talked about Alan Turing and the Turing test, along with John Cirillo in Chinese room with the problems and issues that the Turing test actually has.
