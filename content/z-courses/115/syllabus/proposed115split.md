### How to Get Help in this  Course
CIS 115 can be an interesting course due to the large amount of material covered and much of the material  is brand new to students. Therefore, you are encouraged to seek help whenever you feel you are being overwhelmed or don’t understand a topic. **You are not alone!** Most students in CIS 115 have never studied anything relating to computer science before, so it is new to everyone. The instructors and TAs are ***always*** willing to help students with ***any*** questions you may have about the class or other issues related to Computing Science. So please, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Get help early and often!     

Here are the 5 **recommended ways to get help** on CIS 115:  

- Review the course materials posted on K-State Canvas and the course website 
- Check the [Edstem Discussion board](https://google.com) to see if a similar question has been asked, otherwise, post a new question.

### Course Description

This course is an introduction to the history, fundamental theories, basic programming, and research areas within Computing Science and its related disciplines. Computing Science has a direct impact on many facets of daily life, but very few of us ever take the time to wonder how it all works. This course aims to fill that void. 

To accomplish this goal, we will do several hands-on learning activities, have meaningful in-class discussions, write about our own thoughts and opinions on various subjects, and research topics that are central to Computing Science. While doing so, we will try to relate the concepts we are learning to real-world problems and ideas.  


### Course Objectives
By the end of this course, each student will be able to:

- Describe the history of Computing Science and list some of the important devices, innovations, and people that got us to where we are today.
- Relate Computing Science to a variety of other disciplines and describe how they are interconnected with each other.
- Apply and use Computing Science tools and techniques to solve real-world problems.
- Research and learn about new ideas and areas in Computing Science and share those ideas with others, all without direct guidance.
- Develop a personal understanding of how Computing Science affects his or her own life.
- Understand many different subject areas within Computing Science and how they are changing our understanding of the field.

### Major Course Topics

- The history of Computing Science and early computing machines
- Computational thinking, application of programming, and algorithm design
- The history and technology behind the internet and how it affects our world
- Traditional Computing Science areas such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, high performance computing, big data, robotics, and more
- Cybersecurity in a modern, interconnected world
- Other disciplines and how they relate to Computing Science.

## Course Structure

In short, this course will focus on several learning activities designed to engage and interest students in a variety of topics while helping them think more deeply about each topic and why it is important in Computing Science. This class will require a considerable, but reasonable, amount of effort, not only from the students but the instructors and TAs as well. In addition to exercises and activities, there will be several assignments and group projects to be completed. 

Some of the course will be done online, though most of the course will be delivered through live lectures.  <u>It is expected that you complete the online material/readings **before** you come to class</u> so we can have discussions on that weeks material. Some of the class time will be dedicated to activities and discussions. There will be some content that will be available **only** in class. Each module given will have a quiz over the content covered so it is important to stay caught up on module content each week. Some modules will involve scaffolded programming activities. While this is not a programming course, we will be using programming as a tool to explore big ideas in computer science.

#### Attendance and Participation in Class Activities

**Attendance in class is required**. Many class periods will include hands-on/group activities to be completed in class that will help illustrate the topic of the day. Collaborating and communicating with others in the class is a large part of these activities and is encouraged. Participating in each of these activities is key to learning, so failing to attend class or complete in-class activities will result in a reduced grade for that day’s work. ***Simply attending class does not guarantee that you will receive points\***

**Face coverings** are not required; however, they are encouraged if you are feeling ill. (See general face coverings policy down below)

**Need to miss a class?** Work will never be completely excused, however some exceptions/extensions can be given in 2 situations:

- You are absent due to a **university activity** and have given the instructor **prior notice** of the absence. Excuses after the absence will not be accepted, even for university activities

- You have a "major life event" that prevents you from completing class, such as an illness or family emergency. **These events must be verified through the K-State Office of Student Life**. Contact them **AS SOON AS YOU CAN** once you know you will be away from class. They will work with your instructors while you are gone. Contact your instructor once you are able to discuss make-up work and absences.

{{% notice note%}}
Attendance accommodations include all COVID related causes, but Student Life should still be some of the first people you contact.

### Assignments

{{% notice warning%}}
Assignments are to be completed without any collaboration with classmates or other outside help unless otherwise stated. It is crucial that all work you do is your own. Posting (even if you don’t get a response) course content on Stack Overflow, Chegg, or other similar websites is expressly forbidden and will result in an XF. This also includes viewing solutions to course content that has not been provided to you through canvas by your instructor or TA. The use of AI assisted tools to write your assignments is also explicitly forbidden (ChatGPT, GitHub Code Pilot, etc.). You may use these tools as help in the learning process, but work that you submit for a grade must be 100% done by you and only you.

    *If you are struggling in the course or you have doubts on something, please ask!  Your instructors and TAs are here to help!*
{{% /notice %}}

There will be some programming or written assignments given from time to time that must be completed outside of class. It is acceptable to communicate with other students about the concepts in the assignment if you do not understand it, but you should not discuss the details of how the assignment should be completed. Your submission should be your own work, or the work of your small group if allowed by the instructor.  Some work will require you to look up certain programming syntax and techniques on the internet, **but** there is a fine line between learning and copying! ***When in doubt, ask!***

#### Grading
- 20% - Topic Research and Wiki Article
- 15% - Discussions 
- 20% - Homework
- 25% - Quizzes (*Lowest two scores are dropped*)
- 20% - Final Exam

Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale: 

90% - 100% - A; 80% - 89.99% - B; 70% - 79.99% - C; 60% - 69.99% - D; 00% - 59.99% - F 

#### Late Work

{{% notice warning%}}

Poor planning/procrastination on your part does not constitute as an emergency on ours.

{{% /notice %}}

Every student should strive to turn in work on time. *Late work will receive penalty of 10% of the possible points for each partial day it is late* (pro-rated by hour). **Some assignments will NOT be accepted late**! Others will be limited to a maximum of three days late (not always 3 days). You can see if an assignment is accepted late by seeing if the last available date for that assignment in canvas goes past its due date. Missed class attendance cannot be made up, though as mentioned above some areas will drop the lowest score. If you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor before it becomes too late to recover.

#### Homework

{{% notice warning%}}
We will have some scaffolded programming activities throughout the course. Programming assignments that are turned in and do not run or that are not in the required format will receive a grade of 0, **no exceptions**. My recommendation to avoid making this mistake is to check your solution after you submitted it to Canvas. **Redownload** what you submitted from Canvas and run it again to assure that the program you submitted is working as intended.
{{% /notice %}}

<u>Homework</u> will be individual work unless otherwise stated and is intended to be done outside of class time.  Work that is not your own will be considered a violation of the honor code. Some homework will require some programming and others may require writing (or both). 

#### Team Assignments

Students will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the semester. Each team will be responsible for completing two major projects during the semester. Some group work will include a **REQUIRED** peer evaluation component which can adjust that portion of the individual’s grade up to 50%. If a student should fail to contribute to a group assignment at all, their grade for that assignment will be reduced to a zero. **Failure to complete the peer evaluation will result in a 10% grade deduction for that assignment**.

#### Topic Research

Each team will be given a topic to research. The team will locate and organize materials to use when presenting the topic to the class. The materials should include both online and offline resources. The team will then create a presentation to share the information about their topic with the class. That research will then be used to write the wiki article.

#### Wiki Article
Each team will use the material collected for the topic research project, as well as information from the resulting class discussions, to create an article to be added to the final course wiki. The article is expected to be a thorough examination of the topic and should be written in such a way that others taking this course can read it and understand the material. The team will be responsible for finalizing the entire draft of the wiki and making sure it has a consistent design and feel to it.
