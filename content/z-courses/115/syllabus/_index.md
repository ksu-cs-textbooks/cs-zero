### How to Get Help in this  Course
CIS 115 can be an interesting course due to the large amount of material covered and much of the material  is brand new to students. Therefore, you are encouraged to seek help whenever you feel you are being overwhelmed or don’t understand a topic. **You are not alone!** Most students in CIS 115 have never studied anything relating to computer science before, so it is new to everyone. The instructors and TAs are ***always*** willing to help students with ***any*** questions you may have about the class or other issues related to Computing Science. So please, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Get help early and often!     

Here are the 5 **recommended ways to get help** on CIS 115:  

- Review the course materials posted on K-State Canvas and the course website 
- Check the Edstem Discussion board to see if a similar question has been asked, otherwise, post a new question.
- Visit your professor's office hours, or the office hours for your TA if available  
- Send a message to the CIS 115 Help email ([cis115-help@KSUemailProd.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:cis115-help@KSUemailProd.onmicrosoft.com?subject=CIS%20115%20Help)).
- Ask your classmates for help or advice on assignments or projects (be mindful of the honor code!)
- Schedule a one-on-one meeting with your professor/TA  

#### More on the Ed Discussion board

This semester, we will be using EdStem, specifically, their Ed Discussion platform. You can find the link to access Ed Discussion on Canvas.

Ed Discussion is a reddit/forum style web app that allows students to post and ask questions. This will be our preferred way of communication when it comes to questions/etc. in the course. Please adhere to the following guidelines:
- Before creating a new thread, please make sure there isn't a similar one already made.
- If you are asking a question in Ed Discussion, please correctly mark it as such along with the correct tags.
- Please make your thread public when possible in case others have the same questions.
  - Threads can be made *anonymous* when needed. Course staff may anonymize private threads and make them public if they find it to be beneficial for the class.
- When posting code, please do not post solutions or part of solutions to homework. If you need to share your code with us, please make your thread private.
- If you would like a new category or tag made, please let us know!

### Course Description

This course is an introduction to the history, fundamental theories, basic programming, and research areas within Computing Science and its related disciplines. Computing Science has a direct impact on many facets of daily life, but very few of us ever take the time to wonder how it all works. This course aims to fill that void. 

To accomplish this goal, we will do several hands-on learning activities, have meaningful in-class discussions, write about our own thoughts and opinions on various subjects, and research topics that are central to Computing Science. While doing so, we will try to relate the concepts we are learning to real-world problems and ideas.  


### Course Objectives
By the end of this course, each student will be able to:

- Describe the history of Computing Science and list some of the important devices, innovations, and people that got us to where we are today.
- Relate Computing Science to a variety of other disciplines and describe how they are interconnected with each other.
- Apply and use Computing Science tools and techniques to solve real-world problems.
- Research and learn about new ideas and areas in Computing Science and share those ideas with others, all without direct guidance.
- Develop a personal understanding of how Computing Science affects his or her own life.
- Understand many different subject areas within Computing Science and how they are changing our understanding of the field.

### Major Course Topics

- The history of Computing Science and early computing machines
- Computational thinking, application of programming, and algorithm design
- The history and technology behind the internet and how it affects our world
- Traditional Computing Science areas such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, high performance computing, big data, robotics, and more
- Cybersecurity in a modern, interconnected world
- Other disciplines and how they relate to Computing Science.

## Course Structure

In short, this course will focus on several learning activities designed to engage and interest students in a variety of topics while helping them think more deeply about each topic and why it is important in Computing Science. This class will require a considerable, but reasonable, amount of effort, not only from the students but the instructors and TAs as well. In addition to exercises and activities, there will be several assignments and group projects to be completed. 

Some of the course will be done online, though most of the course will be delivered through live lectures.  <u>It is expected that you complete the online material/readings **before** you come to class</u> so we can have discussions on that weeks material. Some of the class time will be dedicated to activities and discussions. There will be some content that will be available **only** in class. Each module given will have a quiz over the content covered so it is important to stay caught up on module content each week and attend class. Some modules will involve scaffolded programming activities. While this is not a programming course, we will be using programming as a tool to explore big ideas in computer science.

#### Attendance and Participation in Class Activities

**Attendance in class is required**. Some class periods will include hands-on/group activities to be completed in class that will help illustrate the topic of the day. Collaborating and communicating with others in the class is a large part of these activities and is encouraged. Participating in each of these activities is key to learning, so failing to attend class or complete in-class activities will result in a reduced grade for that day’s work. ***Simply attending class does not guarantee that you will receive points\***

**Face coverings** are not required; however, if you are feeling ill, they are encouraged.

**Need to miss a class?** Work will never be completely excused, however some exceptions/extensions can be given in 2 situations:

- You are absent due to a **university activity** and have given the instructor **prior notice** of the absence. Excuses after the absence will not be accepted, even for university activities

- You have a "major life event" that prevents you from completing class, such as an illness or family emergency. **These events must be verified through the K-State Office of Student Support and Accountability**. Contact them **AS SOON AS YOU CAN** once you know you will be away from class. They will work with your instructors while you are gone. Contact your instructor once you are able to discuss make-up work and absences.

{{% notice note%}}
Attendance accommodations include long-term illnesses, such as COVID. The office of Student Support and Accountability should be the first people you contact. Accomodations outside of reasons listed above are not typically granted out of fairness for other students.

### Assignments

{{% notice warning%}}
Assignments are to be completed without any collaboration with classmates or other outside help unless otherwise stated. It is crucial that all work you do is your own. Posting (even if you don’t get a response) course content on Stack Overflow, Chegg, or other similar websites is expressly forbidden and will result in an XF. This also includes viewing solutions to course content that has not been provided to you through canvas by your instructor or TA. The use of AI assisted tools to write your assignments is also explicitly forbidden (ChatGPT, GitHub Code Pilot, etc.). You may use these tools as help in the learning process, but work that you submit for a grade must be 100% done by you and only you.

**If you are struggling in the course or you have doubts on something, please ask!  Your instructors and TAs are here to help!**

{{% /notice %}}

There will be some programming or written assignments given from time to time that must be completed outside of class. It is acceptable to communicate with other students about the concepts in the assignment if you do not understand it, but you should not discuss the details of how the assignment should be completed. Your submission should be your own work, or the work of your small group if allowed by the instructor.  Some work will require you to look up certain concepts and techniques on the internet, **but** there is a fine line between learning and copying! ***When in doubt, ask!***

#### Grading
- 15% - Assignments (*Lowest score dropped*)
- 10% - Discussions
- 25% - Quizzes (*Lowest two scores are dropped*)
- 20% - Topic Research and Wiki Article

- 10% - Final Exam

Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale: 

90% - 100% - A; 80% - 89.99% - B; 70% - 79.99% - C; 60% - 69.99% - D; 00% - 59.99% - F 

#### Late Work

{{% notice warning%}}

Poor planning/procrastination on your part does not constitute as an emergency on ours.

{{% /notice %}}

Every student should strive to turn in work on time. *Late work will receive penalty of 10% of the possible points for each partial day it is late* (pro-rated by hour). **Some assignments will NOT be accepted late**! Others will be limited to a maximum of three days late (not always 3 days). You can see if an assignment is accepted late by seeing if the last available date for that assignment in canvas goes past its due date. Missed class attendance cannot be made up, though as mentioned above some areas will drop the lowest score. If you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor before it becomes too late to recover.

### Artificial Intelligence Usage Policy

This course uses a stoplight approach regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and others. Each assignment or group of assignments will be clearly labelled with one of three labels, indicating what level of GenAI usage is allowed.

{{% notice color="red" %}}

<div style="display: block">

<img src="/cs-zero/images/0/stoplight_red.png" height="120px">
</div>
<div>
{{% badge style="red" %}}RED: GenAI Prohibited {{% /badge %}} You may not use any GenAI tools to complete this assignment. This assignment's main goal is to develop your own skills related to a particular task or topic, or to assess your own understanding of the concepts and skills required for this course. GenAI tools are therefore prohibited for these assignments, as they do not reflect or enhance your own learning journey.
</div>
</div>
<div style="clear: both"></div>

**Policy Violations:** Any usage of GenAI for this assignment will be treated as a violation of the K-State Honor Pledge and may result in a grade of 0 for the assignment and other sanctions approved through the K-State Honor Council.

<div>
{{% badge style="orange" %}}YELLOW: Limited GenAI Usage Allowed {{% /badge %}} You may use GenAI tools in a limited way to complete this assignment. The assignment description may provide additional information about what tools are allowed and how they can be used. The goal of this assignment is to allow you to work with GenAI to complete a task or achieve a goal, but the completed work should still be a majority your own effort. 
</div>
</div>
<div style="clear: both"></div>

**Citations Required:** Any usage of GenAI must be noted and cited directly in the work, either in source code comments or text citations in written work. Citations should include the tool used, the prompt(s) given, context provided to the tool (e.g. existing code), and a discussion of how the results were used to complete the assignment. 

**No Direct AI Results:** For this assignment, you **may not** include the GenAI results directly in your submission - it must be used to inform and adapted to fit your own work. For example, you may not prompt GenAI tools to just _write_ your code and submit that directly; instead, you should ask for help performing specific tasks and then use the results within your own work. 

**Understand Your Work:** To ensure compliance with this policy, the instructor reserves the right to request additional discussion or explanation of any work submitted by a student. The student should understand and be able to clearly explain **all** submitted work and code, even materials directly or indirectly produced by GenAI. A student who is unable to explain a submission to the satisfaction of the instructor may be considered to be in violation of this policy. 

**Policy Violations:** Any usage of GenAI that involves direct submission of the GenAI outputs without additional work done by the student, or use of GenAI without proper citation, may be treated as a violation of the K-State Honor Pledge and may result in a grade of 0 for the assignment and other sanctions approved through the K-State Honor Council.

**Citations Required:** Any usage of GenAI must be noted and cited directly in the work, either in source code comments or text citations in written work. Citations should include the tool used, the prompt(s) given, context provided to the tool (e.g. existing code), and a discussion of how the results were used to complete the assignment.

**Direct AI Results Allowed:** For this assignment, you **may** include the GenAI results directly in your submission. It is still your responsibility to ensure the submission meets the assignment's goals and is correct and factual - remember that GenAI is not infallible and may produce incorrect results. You are still solely responsible for ensuring the submission meets the stated assignment goals, and assignments in this category may receive additional scrutiny for correctness and accuracy. 

**Understand Your Work:** To ensure compliance with this policy, the instructor reserves the right to request additional discussion or explanation of any work submitted by a student. The student should understand and be able to clearly explain **all** submitted work and code, even materials directly or indirectly produced by GenAI. A student who is unable to explain a submission to the satisfaction of the instructor may be considered to be in violation of this policy. 

**Policy Violations:** Any usage of GenAI without proper citation may be treated as a violation of the K-State Honor Pledge and may result in a grade of 0 for the assignment and other sanctions approved through the K-State Honor Council.

{{% /notice %}}

Please contact the instructor if you have any questions about this GenAI policy. It is your responsibility to understand it and proactively ask questions if you are unsure; ignorance of this policy is not an excuse for violating it.

### Artificial Intelligence Disclosure

In keeping with the expectation for transparency and citation regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the instructors of this course will clearly denote any usage of GenAI tools in the process of teaching this class. Specific policies for the usage of GenAI by the instructors and TAs of this course are given below:

* {{% badge style="red" %}}RED: GenAI Prohibited {{% /badge %}} **Grading and Feedback** - GenAI will **never** be used to review student submissions or produce grading feedback. All grades and feedback will be provided by the instructors and TAs without any GenAI assistance.
* {{% badge style="red" %}}RED: GenAI Prohibited {{% /badge %}} **Student Communication** - GenAI will **never** be used to when communicating with students. We believe it is important for students to receive real, authentic communication from instructors and TAs
* {{% badge style="orange" %}}YELLOW: Limited GenAI Usage Allowed {{% /badge %}} **Lesson & Learning Content** - GenAI may be used in a limited way to construct lessons and learning content, such as homework scenarios or simple graphics. All usage of GenAI will be clearly marked and cited. (As of January 2026, no GenAI content exists in the course).

#### Homework

{{% notice warning%}}
We will have some scaffolded programming activities throughout the course. Programming assignments that are turned in and do not run or that are not in the required format will receive a grade of 0, **no exceptions**. My recommendation to avoid making this mistake is to check your solution after you submitted it to Canvas. **Redownload** what you submitted from Canvas and run it again to assure that the program you submitted is working as intended.
{{% /notice %}}

<u>Homework</u> will be individual work unless otherwise stated and is intended to be done outside of class time.  Work that is not your own will be considered a violation of the honor code. Some homework will require some programming and others may require writing (or both). 

#### Team Assignments

Students will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the semester. Each team will be responsible for completing two major projects during the semester. Some group work will include a **REQUIRED** peer evaluation component which can adjust that portion of the individual’s grade up to 50%. If a student should fail to contribute to a group assignment at all, their grade for that assignment will be reduced to a zero. **Failure to complete the peer evaluation will result in a 10% grade deduction for that assignment**.

#### Topic Research

Each team will be given a topic to research. The team will locate and organize materials to use when presenting the topic to the class. The materials should include both online and offline resources. The team will then create a presentation to share the information about their topic with the class. That research will then be used to write the wiki article.

#### Wiki Article
Each team will use the material collected for the topic research project, as well as information from the resulting class discussions, to create an article to be added to the final course wiki. The article is expected to be a thorough examination of the topic and should be written in such a way that others taking this course can read it and understand the material. The team will be responsible for finalizing the entire draft of the wiki and making sure it has a consistent design and feel to it.
