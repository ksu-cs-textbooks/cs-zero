#### Video Script

[Slide 1]

As you work on the materials in this course, you may run into questions or problems and need assistance. 
This video reviews the various types of help available to you in this course.

[Slide 2]

First and foremost, anytime you have a questions or need assistance in the Computational Core program, please contact your teacher at your local school. In most cases, they will be the person best suited to help you and answer any questions you may have. In the case where you have a question they cannot answer, they'll send your question to one of us at K-State, and we'll work with you to get it resolved.

However, beyond just your teachers, there are many other places you can go to get assistance. Let's take a look at a few of them.

[Slide 3]

First, if you have any issues working with K-State Canvas, K-State IT resources, or any other technology related to the delivery of the course, your first source of help is the K-State IT Helpdesk. They can easily be reached via email at helpdesk@ksu.edu. Beyond them, there are many online resources for using Canvas, all of which are linked in the resources section below the video. As a last resort, you may also want to email the help group, but in most cases we may simply redirect you to the K-State helpdesk for assistance.

[Slide 4]

Similarly, if you have any issues using the Codio platform, you are welcome to refer to their online documentation. Their support staff offers a quick and easy chat interface where you can ask questions and get feedback within a few minutes.

[Slide 5]

If you have issues with the technical content of the course, specifically related to completing the tutorials and projects, there are several resources available to you. First and foremost, make sure you consult the vast amount of material available in the course modules, including the links to resources. Usually, most answers you need can be found there.

If you are still stuck or unsure of where to go, the next best thing is to talk with your teacher. As discussed earlier, they will do their best to help you as soon as they can, and if they are stumped they can pass that question along to us.

Of course, as another step you can always exercise your information-gathering skills and use online search tools such as Google to answer your question. 
While you are not allowed to search online for direct solutions to assignments or projects, you are more than welcome to use Google to access programming resources such as StackOverflow, language documentation, and other tutorials. I can definitely assure you that programmers working in industry are often using Google and other online resources to solve problems, so there is no reason why you shouldn't start building that skill now.

[Slide 6]

Next, we have grading and administrative issues. This could include problems or mistakes in the grade you received on a project, missing course resources, or any concerns you have regarding the course and the conduct of myself and your peers. Since this is an online course, you'll be interacting with us on a variety of online platforms, and sometimes things happen that are inappropriate or offensive. There are lots of resources at K-State to help you with those situations. First and foremost, please email me directly as soon as possible and let me know about your concern, if it is appropriate for me to be involved. If not, or if you'd rather talk with someone other than me about your issue, I encourage you to contact either your teacher, the CS department staff, College of Engineering Student Services, or the K-State Office of Student Life. Finally, if you have any concerns that you feel should be reported to K-State, you can do so at [https://www.k-state.edu/report/](https://www.k-state.edu/report/). That site also has links to a large number of resources at K-State that you can use when you need help.

[Slide 7]

Finally, if you find any errors or omissions in the course content, or have suggestions for additional resources to include in the course, let your teacher know so they can pass that along to me. There are some extra credit points available for helping to improve the course, so be on the lookout for anything that you feel could be changed or improved.

[Slide 8]

So, in summary, your first stop for help should almost always be your teacher. For issues with Canvas or Codio, you are also welcome to refer directly to the resources for those platforms. For questions specifically related to the projects, use those resources or contact your teacher. For grading questions and errors in the course content or any other issues, please also contact your teachers for assistance.Our goal in this program is to make sure that you have the resources available to you to be successful. Please don't be afraid to take advantage of them and ask questions whenever you want.
