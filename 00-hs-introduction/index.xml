      <description>YouTube Video Resources K-State Honor &amp;amp; Integrity System Video Script &amp;ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&amp;rdquo; - K-State Honor Pledge
Plagiarism is a very serious concern in this course, and something that we do not take lightly. Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.</description>
