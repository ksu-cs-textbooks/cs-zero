Hello and welcome to the Cyber Pipeline program!
My name is Russ Feldhausen, and I’ll be one of the instructors for this program.
[Slide 2]
There are many other instructors for this program that you may see in the tutorial videos. They all have been instrumental in the development of this program. You’ll see me, along with many of my colleagues at Kansas State University, in the videos throughout this course.</description></item><item><title>Navigating Canvas &amp; Codio</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-hs-introduction/02-navigating-canvas-codio/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-hs-introduction/02-navigating-canvas-codio/index.html</guid><description>Resources Codio Documentation Video Script This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before.

This isn’t just anecdotal evidence from computer science teachers like me, but theories and research from education researchers who study how humans learn new skills and abilities throughout their lives.If I had to summarize all of this information in as few words as possible, I’d simply say “do the work.” Learning to program is difficult, and the only way to really get good at it is through constant practice and learning. However, that greatly oversimplifies the information that I want to share, and I’m hoping that you’ll find some helpful takeaways from this video that you can incorporate into your learning process.</description></item><item><title>CC 110 Syllabus - Fall 2025</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-hs-introduction/06-cc110-syllabus/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-hs-introduction/06-cc110-syllabus/index.html</guid><description>Info This is the official syllabus for the concurrent enrollment version of this course.

Plagiarism is a very serious concern in this course, and something that we do not take lightly. Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.</description></item></channel></rss>
