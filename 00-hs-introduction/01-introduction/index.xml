Hello and welcome to the Cyber Pipeline program!
My name is Russ Feldhausen, and I’ll be one of the instructors for this program.

You’ll see me, along with many of my colleagues at Kansas State University, in the videos throughout this course.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-hs-introduction/01-introduction/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
