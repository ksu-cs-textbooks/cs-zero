They all have been instrumental in the development of this program. You&rsquo;ll see me, along with many of my colleagues at Kansas State University, in the videos throughout this course.</p><p>[Slide 3]</p><p>For help in this course, you should first start by contacting your high school teacher. In most cases, they will be the best person to help you out, since they&rsquo;ll be closely working with you as you work through this course.</p><p>They also have my contact information and can reach out to me directly if there are any issues with the course or additional questions that I can answer.</p><p>[Slide 4]</p><p>In addition to Canvas, we’ll be using the online learning platform Codio for most of the programming tutorials and projects in this program. We’ll also discuss how to use Codio later in this module.</p><p>[Slide 5]</p><p>The Cyber Pipeline program consists of several courses, and each course contains a number of learning modules. Each module will usually consist of some lecture material and quizzes, and there are a few modules which include a programming component. The modules themselves are gated, which means that you must complete each item in the module in order before continuing. In addition, the modules enforce prerequisite requirements from other modules.</p><p>You are welcome to work on this course at any time during the week as your schedule allows, provided that you complete each module before the listed due date. Your teachers will work with you to set due dates for your individual class. The modules are self-contained, but have some differences in grading.</p><p>[Slide 6]</p><p>Looking ahead to the rest of this introductory module, you’ll see that there are a few more items to be completed before you can move on. In the next video, we&rsquo;ll discuss a bit more information about navigating through this course on Canvas and using the Codio learning environment.</p><p>[Slide 7]</p><p>One thing we highly encourage each of you to do is read the syllabus for this course in its entirety, and let us know if you have any questions. My view is that the syllabus is a contract between me as your teacher and you as a student, defining how each of us should treat each other and what we should expect from each other. Finally, the syllabus itself is subject to change as needed as we adapt this program to meet the needs of its students, and all changes will be clearly communicated to everyone before they take effect.</p><p>Your high school teachers may also give you an addition to this syllabus that outlines their own expectations in the classroom, including how they will handle due dates and late work. So, their statements will take precedence over my syllabus in your classroom.</p><p>[Slide 8]</p><p>The grading schemes for each of these courses are pretty simple.</p><p>In CC 110, 80% of the grade comes from completing the tutorials & quizzes, and 20% of the grade comes from participating in the discussions around various computer science topics.</p><p>For CC 111, 60% of the grade comes from the lab assignments that introduce new programming concepts, and 40% of the grade comes from the homeworks you&rsquo;ll complete to demonstrate what you&rsquo;ve learned in the labs.</p><p>Finally, for CC 210, 70% of the grade comes from the programming projects, and 30% of the grade is from the tutorials.</p><p>In each of these classes, your teacher may choose to adjust the weights used in this grading scheme. They will let you know of any changes they&rsquo;ve made.</p><p>[Slide 9]</p><p>In this program, the standard &ldquo;90-80-70-60&rdquo; grading scale will apply, though your teacher reserves the right to curve grades up to a higher grade level at their discretion. Therefore, you will never be required to get higher than 90% for an A, but you may get an A if you score slightly below 90% if they choose to curve the grades.</p><p>[Slide 10]</p><p>This is intended to be a completely online, self-paced course. There are no mandatory scheduled course times. All of the content is available online, so you can work whenever and wherever you want. Therefore, your teacher will work with your class to set a schedule that works best in your situation. However, remember that each module may require 4 to 6 or more hours of work to complete, so make sure you have plenty of time available to devote to this course.</p><p>In addition, due to the flexible online format of this class, there won&rsquo;t be any long lecture videos to watch. Instead, each module will consist of a guided tutorial and several short videos, each focused on a particular topic or task. Likewise, there won&rsquo;t be any textbooks required, since all of the information will be presented in the interactive tutorials through Codio. Finally, since we are using Codio as our learning platform, you won&rsquo;t have to deal with installing and using a clunky integrated development environment, or IDE, just to learn how to program. Codio helps make learning to program quick and painless by moving everything to the web.</p><p>[Slide 11]</p><p>For this course, the only supplies you&rsquo;ll need as a student are access to a modern web browser and a broadband internet connection. No other special hardware or software is necessary!</p><p>[Slide 12]</p><p>Finally, as you are aware, this course is always subject to change. This is a relatively new program here at K-State, and we’re always working on new and interesting ideas to integrate into the courses. The best advice I have is to look upon this graphic with the words “Don’t Panic” written in large, friendly letters. If you find yourself falling behind, or not understanding, please contact your teacher for assistance.</p><p>[Slide 13]</p><p>So, to complete this module, there are a few other things that you&rsquo;ll need to do. The next step is to watch the video on navigating Canvas and Codio, which will give you a good idea of how to most effectively work through the content in this course.</p><p>To get to that video, click the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button at the bottom right of this page.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cs-zero/js/clipboard.min.js?1753300008 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1753300008 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/theme.js?1753300008 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/tele-scroll.js?1753300008 defer></script></body></html>
