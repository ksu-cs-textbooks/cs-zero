Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.</p><p>At its core, plagiarism is taking someone else&rsquo;s work and passing it off as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original source. As a student in this program, we ask you to abide by the K-State Honor Code not to accept any unauthorized aid, and this includes plagiarized code.</p><p>When it comes to plagiarism in computer code, there is a fine line between using resources appropriately and copying code. In this program, you should strive to avoid plagiarism issues by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Do not search for or use any complete solutions to projects in this course found online or from fellow students.</li><li>Small portions of code may be used or adapted from an online source with proper citation. To cite a piece of code, include a code comment section above it that contains the original source URL and a description of why it was used.</li><li>Do not ask AI tools such as ChatGPT or GitHub copilot to write your code for you.</li></ol><p>In general, copying or adapting small pieces of code to perform auxiliary functions in the assignment is permitted. Copying or adapting code that is the general goal of the assignment should be avoided. For example, if the assignment is to create a bubble sort algorithm, you should write the algorithm from scratch yourself since that is the goal of the assignment. If the assignment is to create a program for displaying data that you feel should be sorted, you may choose to adapt an existing sorting algorithm for your needs (or use one from a library).</p><p>Likewise, it is perfectly fine to use AI tools like ChatGPT to better understand your code or what it does, but you shouldn&rsquo;t ask it to just solve your problem for you. It is your responsibility to understand what every line of code in your program does, because you can&rsquo;t rely on AI to always get the right answer.</p><p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure about whether it is OK to use an online resource or piece of code in this course, please contact the instructors using the course discussion forums or help email address. You will not get in trouble for asking, and it will help you determine what the best course of action is. Plagiarism can really only occur when you submit the assignment for grading, so you are welcome to ask for clarification or a judgement on whether a particular usage is acceptable at any time before you submit the assignment.</p><p>Codio has features that will compare your submissions against those of your fellow students. Any submissions with a high degree of similarity may be subjected to additional scrutiny by the instructors to determine if plagiarism has occurred.</p><p>In this course, any violation of the K-State Honor Code will result in a 0 on that assignment. A second violation will result in an F in this course, as well as any additional sanctions imposed by your school.</p><p>For more information on the K-State Honor & Integrity system, please visit <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/honor/ rel=external target=_blank>their website</a>, which is linked in the resources section below this video.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main><div class=git-footer><p class=theme-version-footer>6.0.0</p><p>Last modified by:
