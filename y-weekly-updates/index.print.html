<h4 id="edited-transcript">Edited Transcript</h4>
<p>Hello and welcome to cc 110. I am Emily Alfs-Votipka and I&rsquo;ll be your instructor for this semester. Feel free to call me Emily or Mrs. Alfs-Votipka. Either is fine with me, I wanted to just do a quick announcement video of what you can expect for this first week and just general tips for the course.</p>
<p>The first thing that I wanted to share is ways to contact me. The best way for course related stuff is using the CC 110 Help email, which is here in the syllabus. With your K-State email, you should be able to just type cc 110 hyphen, help and hit tab and it should autocomplete the rest of this email. My personal email is here as well it&rsquo;s <a href="mailto:emilyalfs@ksu.edu">emilyalfs@ksu.edu</a>
. I do prefer for course communications though that you use the CC 110 help. The other benefit of using the CC 110 Help email is that it also goes to the undergraduate teaching assistants. So if you email that email, you may get a response from myself or Carrie or Nathan or Nate or Emma or Ryan.</p>
<p>They also will have office hours. The main cc 110 uta will be Carrie. And so if you have any questions about Codio, or things related to how the course is running, Carrie is the best TA to reach out to during office hours. Also feel free to reach out to me as well though. However any of these TAs would be able to answer questions about Python. So these four TAs are for CIS 115, which is the computer science specific version of this course. Whereas this course serves more for the computational core or the integrated computer science degree.</p>
<p>Here we have the schedule of office hours. And again, you&rsquo;ll notice there are some cis 115 courses listed here. And that is because the TAs serving dual purpose of having office hours available for CIS 115 and CC 110. So again, just to stress if you have any Python questions, you may visit any of their office hours. However, if you have any cardio or more tool related questions, you&rsquo;ll need to talk with Carrie or myself specifically.</p>
<p>This semester, we are trying scheduling a little bit different. So if you think we could be doing something more different or better, please let me know.</p>
<p>So what will happen is week to week, you&rsquo;ll need to check if you have a programming assignment. And you&rsquo;ll also need to read the relevant chapters. The easiest way to keep track of this is the either the to do list on the right hand side. So this tells you all of the pertinent due dates and has them in order of earliest or soonest the latest due dates. You can also look at the course calendar. And the course calendar will show you a overview of when things are due. So we can see we have a lab and some reading some lab and reading.</p>
<p>It may be tempting to just click on one of these, but you&rsquo;ll need to make sure that you read the appropriate module content before taking the quiz. So for example, this programming quiz is a part of chapter four. So you will need to make sure that you read Chapter Four before attempting that quiz.</p>
<p>So in the modules, they do have often prerequisites and also requirements to complete the module. Here we can see that I have completed the requirements for five of the module contents, I have not finished the syllabus yet. And I have not finished these down here either. This symbol on the top right shows me that I am not done with this module yet. And I need to complete all the items still.</p>
<p>In this programming module and says that my prerequisite is that I finished all of Chapter zero. And similarly for chapter one, I need to make sure that I finished chapter zero first. And then for Chapter Two, I need to read chapter one first and so on.</p>
<p>I would like to point out there are a few places and I&rsquo;ll mention this in a future announcement video as well. But I just want to draw attention to it. Now, there are some chapters that are numerically out of order. But in terms of content or concept, they&rsquo;re pretty in line. So for example, chapter 12 is over how the internet works. And then chapter 19 is about search and information retrieval. So this kind of goes hand in hand with searching the web and page rank. So we still have though that you know to do chapter 12, you have to do chapter 11 first, and then to do chapter 19 you have to do chapter 12 first.</p>
<p>So for this first week, you&rsquo;ll need to finish chapter zero that&rsquo;s by the 26th then for the week after that you will need to do lab two, which will be due on Thursday, September 1. And then you&rsquo;ll need to read chapters one and two and take the respective quizzes and do this discussion.</p>
<p>I will have some in person office hours. And I will also have a component where we can meet virtually if needed. I will make an announcement once those office hour times are set.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s all that I have for you for this first Announcements video. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to reach out using that help email.</p>
<p>I wish you well for the first week of classes for this fall semester. And please don&rsquo;t be afraid to reach out if you have any questions.</p>
