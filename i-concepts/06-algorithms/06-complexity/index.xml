So let’s take a minute and try and decide which of those algorithms do you think is faster for a computer? a better question might be, which of those two algorithms was faster for you as it person to perform? Those are really tough questions to answer, aren’t they? And so we need some way that we can analyze our algorithms and compare them apples to apples to see exactly which algorithm might be faster or more efficient on a computer. To do that, we use something called Big O notation. Unfortunately, when I refer to big O notation, I’m not talking about the giant robot anime from the early 2000s. Instead, I’m talking about the notation that we use to express the complexity of an algorithm. And specifically when we talk about complexity, we’re talking about the number of steps required to perform the algorithm based on the worst case size of the inputs.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/06-algorithms/06-complexity/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
