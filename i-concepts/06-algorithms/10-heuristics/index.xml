However, what if we’re faced with a problem that we can’t solve? Either because it’s impossible, or because we have so much data that we can’t possibly find the one right answer using an algorithm. In that case, we would use something we call a heuristic.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/06-algorithms/10-heuristics/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
