Bubble sort might seem similar to Insertion Sort, but it’s actually quite the different algorithm. So in bubble sort, what we will do is we will start by comparing two side by side elements in the list of data. And then if they’re out of order, we will swap them. You can see in the animation above me how those two red boxes move to compare two side by side items. And if they’re out of order, it will swap them just like so. Then we’ll repeat that once we get all the way to the end of the array. We’ll start back over at the beginning, and we’ll go through it multiple times until it is entirely sorted. Or as the algorithm says here, we’ll continue until we go all the way through the array and we don’t make any more swaps. So let’s go take a look at how to perform bubblesort using our deck of cards. The next algorithm we will look at is the bubble sort algorithm as we do bubblesort keep track of how many times you swap to different cards as that will become really important as we analyze these algorithms later on in this module.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/06-algorithms/05-bubble-sort/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
