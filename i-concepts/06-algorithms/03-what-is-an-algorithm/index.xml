A good definition for an algorithm is a finite list of specific instructions for carrying out a procedure or solving a problem. If you think about it, every computer program we write consists of many different algorithms. Because as we’ve learned, writing a computer program is exactly that. It’s giving the computer a list of very specific instructions that we’d like it to carry out so that it can perform a task or solve a problem for us.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/06-algorithms/03-what-is-an-algorithm/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
