Grace Hopper enlisted in the Navy and worked on the Harvard Mark I computer, as well as the UNIVAC, a successor to the ENIAC, and we&rsquo;ll talk about the UNIVAC and ENIAC computers in another lecture. So grace also developed a programming language called FlowMatic which was later adapted into a language called COBOL, which is still somewhat used today. COBOL is traditionally a language that was used very heavily in the financial industry, because it was used to generate a lot of financial reports. You don&rsquo;t see it a whole lot now, you may see it used occasionally at places like banks, or accounting firms and things like that, but it&rsquo;s not very widely used anymore.</p><p>But beyond that, she was a truly a pioneer and out of the box thinker for her entire life. And as you&rsquo;ll see in the following videos, Grace Hopper is a pretty sassy lady but a pioneer in modern computing. She was also pretty famous for her description of a nanosecond in the Dave letterman show, which you&rsquo;ll see here in just a little bit. Another thing here every year, there is a Grace Hopper conference to celebrate diversity and inclusion and women in computing. And so there&rsquo;s actually scholarships available for students if you would like to attend this conference. And it&rsquo;s something that I would highly recommend if you ever get the chance, it is truly a great experience to actually participate in.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/si9iqF5uTFk style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cs-zero/js/clipboard.min.js?1756077497 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1756077497 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/theme.js?1756077497 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/embed-iframe.js?1756077497 defer></script></body></html>
