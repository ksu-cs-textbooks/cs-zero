First off, what exactly is a language. Something that we don’t really think about very often though. A language really is just a set of symbols, whether it be gestures, words, sign language, or even Braille, that are used in a uniform fashion to allow people to communicate with one another. We have to take a look at how we as humans can communicate with a physical or inanimate object: a computer. In order for us to tell computers what to do, we had to develop a language that we could use to communicate with it. Here on my slide I have on the left a bunch of different ways on how to say good morning, in various human languages that we use to communicate with with one another. And on the right side here we have a bunch of computer languages that we have. So the first one up here is happens to be Python 2, Python 3, C, Java, JavaScript, and even Rust. And so this is just a small number of different things that we would be able to use to communicate this particular message to our computer. Just likewise, we have a lot of different ways we could say good morning to someone.</description></item><item><title>Grace Hopper</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/02-grace-hopper/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/02-grace-hopper/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Our next famous woman in computer science that we’ll be talking about is Rear Admiral Grace Hopper. Grace Hopper enlisted in the Navy and worked on the Harvard Mark I computer, as well as the UNIVAC, a successor to the ENIAC, and we’ll talk about the UNIVAC and ENIAC computers in another lecture. So grace also developed a programming language called FlowMatic which was later adapted into a language called COBOL, which is still somewhat used today. COBOL is traditionally a language that was used very heavily in the financial industry, because it was used to generate a lot of financial reports. You don’t see it a whole lot now, you may see it used occasionally at places like banks, or accounting firms and things like that, but it’s not very widely used anymore.</description></item><item><title>The Queen of Code</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/03-queen-of-code/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/03-queen-of-code/index.html</guid><description>Due to the privacy settings, we were not able to embed the following video directly.

Margaret was the director of software engineering at MIT’s instrumentation lab. Margaret Hamilton was also known as the, essentially the creator of the field of software engineering, essentially. But the reason why she is credited for software engineering is that she was responsible for a team that developed onboard flight software for the Apollo space program. During this timeframe, her program actually prevented a mission abort during the Apollo 11 moon landing, which is kind of crazy cool to think about right.</description></item><item><title>Software in Space</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/06-software-in-space/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/06-software-in-space/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>What is Programming?</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/07-what-is-programming/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/07-what-is-programming/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script So what really is programming? Right? We’ve talked about a lot of famous women in computer science so far, that have been very influential; the first computer programmer Ada Lovelace, the queen of software Grace Hopper, and Margaret Hamilton, who really pioneered the idea of software engineering, best practices with computer programming. But, what does that really actually entail? Well, programming itself, right computer programming, is simply the act of designing, writing, debugging and maintaining the source code of a computer program.</description></item><item><title>Early Programming (Crash Course)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/08-early-programming/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/08-early-programming/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>The First Programming Languages (Crash Course)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/09-first-languages/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/09-first-languages/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Pattern on the Stone Reading</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/10-pots-reading/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/10-pots-reading/index.html</guid><description>Read Pattern on the Stone, Chapter 3.</description></item></channel></rss>
