First off, what exactly is a language. Something that we don’t really think about very often though. A language really is just a set of symbols, whether it be gestures, words, sign language, or even Braille, that are used in a uniform fashion to allow people to communicate with one another.</description></item><item><title>Grace Hopper</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/02-grace-hopper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/02-grace-hopper/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Our next famous woman in computer science that we’ll be talking about is Rear Admiral Grace Hopper. Grace Hopper enlisted in the Navy and worked on the Harvard Mark I computer, as well as the UNIVAC, a successor to the ENIAC, and we’ll talk about the UNIVAC and ENIAC computers in another lecture. So grace also developed a programming language called FlowMatic which was later adapted into a language called COBOL, which is still somewhat used today.</description></item><item><title>The Queen of Code</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/03-queen-of-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/03-queen-of-code/</guid><description>Due to the privacy settings, we were not able to embed the following video directly.

Margaret was the director of software engineering at MIT’s instrumentation lab. Margaret Hamilton was also known as the, essentially the creator of the field of software engineering, essentially. But the reason why she is credited for software engineering is that she was responsible for a team that developed onboard flight software for the Apollo space program.</description></item><item><title>Software in Space</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/06-software-in-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/06-software-in-space/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>What is Programming?</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/07-what-is-programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/07-what-is-programming/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script So what really is programming? Right? We’ve talked about a lot of famous women in computer science so far, that have been very influential in the first computer programmer. Right. So Ada Lovelace, the queen of software, Grace Hopper, and Margaret Hamilton, who really pioneered the idea of software engineering, best practices with computer programming. But, what does that really actually entail? Well, programming itself, right computer programming, is simply the act of designing, writing, debugging and maintaining the source code of a computer program.</description></item><item><title>Early Programming (Crash Course)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/08-early-programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/08-early-programming/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>The First Programming Languages (Crash Course)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/09-first-languages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/09-first-languages/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>Pattern on the Stone Reading</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/10-pots-reading/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/04-programming/10-pots-reading/</guid><description>Read Pattern on the Stone, Chapter 3.</description></item></channel></rss>
