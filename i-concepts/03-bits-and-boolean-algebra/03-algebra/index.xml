Thankfully, most of the rules you know, apply quite well, but there’s one rule that needed to be added. In mathematics. When you multiply by negative one, you have to change the signs. Similarly, Augustus DeMorgan came up with a way to deal with the negation of entire Boolean logic statements. So this becomes very similar to how you multiply a statement or a regular mathematical statement by a negative one. I guess system marking came up with a way to deal with the negation of entire Boolean logic statements. The DeMorgan’s theorem essentially states to treat the NOT operator like the negative sign so you’re going to apply the negative to each of the premises or facts and then swap the operators or basically and become or’s and or’s become hands. So let’s take a look at an example. So if we invert our particular statement here where we have a and b, right, so A and B, not a and b becomes not a or not B, so we negated or applied the knot to a and the knots to b and the knot and becomes or similar idea for or not a or b becomes not a, and not B.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/03-bits-and-boolean-algebra/03-algebra/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
