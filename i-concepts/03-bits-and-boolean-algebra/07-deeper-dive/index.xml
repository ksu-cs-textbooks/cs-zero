Unfortunately, this is not well explained or covered elsewhere in online resources, but we find that it is really helpful to revisit these concepts here before the end of this module.
Don’t sweat it! This is a lot of conceptual information to digest at once. However, we don’t expect you to become proficient in this right away! This is just meant to be an introduction to the concept of Boolean Logic and Boolean Algebra, which you’ll become more comfortable with over time as you practice your programming skills and take later classes in Computer Science.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/03-bits-and-boolean-algebra/07-deeper-dive/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
