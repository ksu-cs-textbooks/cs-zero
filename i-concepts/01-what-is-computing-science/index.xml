      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Introduction (Slides 1-3) In this course, we&amp;rsquo;re going to ask ourselves, what is computing science? It&amp;rsquo;s a really important topic that we&amp;rsquo;d like to cover throughout this course. But it&amp;rsquo;s also one that&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to understand. So when we try and understand the topics such as what is computing science, we can ask ourselves the questions: who? what? when? where? why? and how?</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Notes About This Selection The director of the Computer Science Museum&amp;rsquo;s Babbage Project demonstrates how Charles Babbage&amp;rsquo;s Difference Engine #2 works. While Babbage himself was not able to build the machine in his lifetime, a modern builder created it according to Babbage&amp;rsquo;s instructions. Through this creation, computer scientists have been able to prove that the Difference Engine works exactly as Babbage intended!
Reference WIRED. (2008, May 2). Babbage’s Difference Engine No.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Charles Babbage (Slides 23-17) Charles Babbage designed many different engines during his lifetime, but very few of them were actually built.
In the previous video, you saw a completed version of the Difference Engine built very recently, which we actually see here. And his Difference Engine was very revolutionary because it proved that you could build a device that was purely mechanical, that could perform calculations.</description>
