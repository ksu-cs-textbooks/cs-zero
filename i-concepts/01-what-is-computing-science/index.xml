It’s a really important topic that we’d like to cover throughout this course. But it’s also one that’s very difficult to understand. So when we try and understand the topics such as what is computing science, we can ask ourselves the questions: who? what? when? where? why? and how?</description></item><item><title>Babbage's Difference Engine</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/01-what-is-computing-science/02-babbage-diff-eng-num-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/01-what-is-computing-science/02-babbage-diff-eng-num-2/</guid><description>YouTube Video Notes About This Selection The director of the Computer Science Museum’s Babbage Project demonstrates how Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine #2 works. While Babbage himself was not able to build the machine in his lifetime, a modern builder created it according to Babbage’s instructions. Through this creation, computer scientists have been able to prove that the Difference Engine works exactly as Babbage intended!
Reference WIRED. (2008, May 2). Babbage’s Difference Engine No.</description></item><item><title>Charles Babbage</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/01-what-is-computing-science/03-babbage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/01-what-is-computing-science/03-babbage/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Charles Babbage (Slides 23-17) Charles Babbage designed many different engines during his lifetime, but very few of them were actually built.
In the previous video, you saw a completed version of the Difference Engine built very recently, which we actually see here. And his Difference Engine was very revolutionary because it proved that you could build a device that was purely mechanical, that could perform calculations.</description></item><item><title>Pattern on the Stone Reading</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/01-what-is-computing-science/05-pots-reading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/01-what-is-computing-science/05-pots-reading/</guid><description>Read Pattern on the Stone, Chapter 1 - Nuts and Bolts.
