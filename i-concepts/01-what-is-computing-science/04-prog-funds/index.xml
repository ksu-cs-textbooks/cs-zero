These concepts are crucial in helping us be better programmers and problem solvers.
First we will talk about decomposition. This is the process of breaking something down into smaller pieces. We can think of the biological process where organic matter decomposes and breaks apart into smaller organic elements.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/01-what-is-computing-science/04-prog-funds/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
