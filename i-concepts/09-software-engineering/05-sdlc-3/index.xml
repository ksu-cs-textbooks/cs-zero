This allows for a lot more change and variation to the development cycle. So the iterative development process works by working through many waterfalls. And so if you look at each one of these chunks here, each one of these stages, they’re pretty much the waterfall process. And so overall requirements are gathered, then we analyze those requirements develop, implement test, and this is a cycle right? In this case, our waterfall is circular so we can keep on trying Go Go, go, go go. And then we’re going to release a prototype or a version of our product. As we go through this each time a release, we demonstrate that to our customer. And get feedback and then we’ll work that back into our next cycle. And so we just keep on iterating this until we are doing our final release to our customer.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/09-software-engineering/05-sdlc-3/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
