So this one is in complete contrast to the waterfall model of software development and pretty much all other development methodologies. Because this methodology, there really isn’t anything to it. It’s generally known as cowboy coding or code and fix. Now, this in many ways, is the anti software engineering approach, where planning, testing documentation at pretty much everything, all of that is ignored, or immediately writing code. And predictably, this leads to a lot of what we refer to as spaghetti code. And so it’s just mangled structure that has really no clear way to it at sprinkled with sub optimal algorithms memory leaks, structural issues is just a mess, right? Imagine getting out a box of Christmas lights that were just thrown into a box and in January, and you go back in December, try to put those Christmas lights up. And magically, they’ve aimed together into this big ball that takes hours upon hours to actually unravel. And sometimes it’s just easier to throw it away and start from scratch.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/09-software-engineering/04-sdlc-2/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
