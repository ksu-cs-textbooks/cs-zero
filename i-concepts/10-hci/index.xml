It is the study of how computers and humans interact and how we design computers to better support humans in that efforts. HCI is one of the fields that we’re going to look at it throughout the semester, we’ll do this several times.</description></item><item><title>The Mother of All Demos</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/02-mother-of-all-demos/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/02-mother-of-all-demos/index.html</guid><description>The full video of the Mother of All Demos is linked below, but it is nearly 2 hours long. While we’d love to have you watch the whole thing (and you are more than welcome to do so), we wanted to highlight a few of the more important parts. Listed below are the timestamps for a few important sections and a bit of discussion about each one. Feel free to skip around to watch a few of these sections to better understand what Douglas Engelbart was presenting.</description></item><item><title>The Desktop Metaphor</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/03-desktop-metaphor/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/03-desktop-metaphor/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script On the previous page in NLS was a very revolutionary system. Unfortunately, it was very hard for the average user to use. And so it really never could gain that mainstream reputation that it wanted. So we had to come up with an easier way to use modern computer systems.</description></item><item><title>Clip from Pirates of Silicon Valley (Dramatization)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/04-pirates-of-silicon-valley/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/04-pirates-of-silicon-valley/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>What is Good HCI?</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/05-good-hci/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/05-good-hci/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script So now that we’ve seen some examples of historical computer interactions, let’s talk about what it might take to make a good computer interface today. Think about the computer systems that you interact with on a daily basis. What about them makes them easy to use or difficult to use? Would your answer change if you gave that computer system to a toddler, or maybe your grandmother or an elderly person? So really good human computer interaction or good computer interfaces can depend widely based on the needs of the audience. Of course, there are some things that we can think about that make good human computer interactions. For example, we want it to be functional, it needs to do what it says it does. It needs to be reliable, it should always work the way we expect it to. It needs to have a high level of usability. So it’s something we can easily and effectively work with. It should be efficient. We don’t want to have to click 18 times to open up a single web page do we? It also should be maintainable both from the ideas of the user, it should be easy for them to keep their computer up and running. But it should also be maintainable on the software side for the developers that are building these apps. And one of the things that I think is often overlooked in the field of HCI, is it should be portable. We really want the same ideas to work across multiple different devices and even multiple different paradigms. And that’s something we’ll talk about a little bit later.</description></item><item><title>The Microsoft Bob Experience: Was It Really THAT Bad?</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/06-ms-bob/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/06-ms-bob/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Future of HCI</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/07-the-future/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/07-the-future/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script One person who’s very active in the field of HCI today is Don Norman. Don Norman was a 2006 Franklin medalist. And he’s really famous for writing a book called The Design of Everyday Things, which if you haven’t taken a look at it, I encourage you to at least look at the front cover of that book and see what he’s talking about. Don Norman is a real big proponent of designing things to be how they’re expected to be used instead of design just to be interesting. And he talks about some really great examples of designing for everyday things. And so after this video, we’ll take a look at a short clip of Don Norman talking about some of his work, and hopefully, you’ll start to see the things that he saw in the real world that helped us understand modern design.</description></item><item><title>User Centered Design - Don Norman</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/08-user-centered/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/08-user-centered/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Graphical User Interfaces (Crash Course)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/09-gui-crash-course/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/09-gui-crash-course/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Pattern on the Stone Reading</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/10-pots-reading/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/10-pots-reading/index.html</guid><description>Read Pattern on the Stone, Chapter 9.</description></item><item><title>Multi-touch Interfaces - Jeff Han on TED Talks</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/11-multi-touch-interfaces/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/11-multi-touch-interfaces/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>10/GUI Multi-touch Concept Video</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/12-multi-touch-concept/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/12-multi-touch-concept/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Google Glass How-to: Getting Started</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/13-google-glass/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/13-google-glass/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jacob Tries the Oculus Rift (Warning - Strong Language)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/14-oculus-rift/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/14-oculus-rift/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dasher: Information Efficient Text Entry (Demo starts at 6:18)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/15-dasher/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/10-hci/15-dasher/index.html</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
