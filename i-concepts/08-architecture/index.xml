While those machines were very powerful, a failure of any one of those components or joints could cause problems for several hours as engineers tried to solve it.
This problem was really best summed up by Jack Morton, the Vice President of Bell Labs.</description></item><item><title>IC Invention (Integrated Circuits - Jack Kilby)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/02-ic-jack-kilby/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/02-ic-jack-kilby/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Integrated Circuits (Part 2)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/03-integrated-circuits/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/03-integrated-circuits/</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script The device that Jack Kilby pioneered is shown here, it is the first integrated circuit. What we have here is a piece of germanium with several components printed directly on to the semiconductor material and a few wires coming off of it. And while it may not look like much now, if you connect the wires up properly, you can actually see a sine wave on an oscilloscope produced by this device.</description></item><item><title>Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/04-cramming-components/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/04-cramming-components/</guid><description>This paper is by Gordon E.

However, a fixed program computer has some limitations. A fixed program computer can only perform one task without being completely rebuilt and redesigned for another task. While this may seem very powerful, it is actually very limiting. So examples of fixed program computers would be Babbage’s Difference Engine.</description></item><item><title>Computer Hardware</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/07-computer-parts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/07-computer-parts/</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Let’s spend a little bit more time looking at modern computer hardware and talking about some of the things that are related to what we’ve already discussed in this lab. On our modern CPUs, one of the things we have to keep in mind is the instruction set architecture or ISA, that is built around the ISA determines how the CPU actually interprets the binary ones and zeros in the program code and turns that into instructions that it can follow to perform the calculations needed.</description></item><item><title>Finite State Machines</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/08-finite-state-machines/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/08-finite-state-machines/</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script So far, we’ve looked at the parts of a modern computer all the way from the integrated circuit to the CPU and RAM that we have in our modern computers. But we still haven’t talked about how we can use those computers to represent real world systems and actually do something useful. To do that, we have to look at one more thing from computer science called the finite state machine.</description></item></channel></rss>
