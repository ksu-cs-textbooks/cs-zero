What we have here is a piece of germanium with several components printed directly on to the semiconductor material and a few wires coming off of it. And while it may not look like much now, if you connect the wires up properly, you can actually see a sine wave on an oscilloscope produced by this device. They call this device an integrated circuit because the circuit between all of the components and the wiring is all connected directly onto the piece of germanium.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/i-concepts/08-architecture/03-integrated-circuits/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
