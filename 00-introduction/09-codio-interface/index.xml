Of course, Codio has some amazing documentation, so feel free to check that out as you work with Codio.
First, let’s look at the menu items at the top of the page. There are several available to you that are worth mentioning. For starters, you can click the Codio Icon at any time to go directly to your Codio dashboard. The first item on the Codio menu will take you directly here as well. There you can see all of the projects attached to your account, and create new projects at any time. However, you won’t see the projects attached to the course here, since they must be accessed directly through Canvas.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-introduction/09-codio-interface/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
