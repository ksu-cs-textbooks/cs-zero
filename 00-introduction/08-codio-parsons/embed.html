These problems are great ways to practice the logic of programming without having to remember how to type each line of code yourself. You can think of them like a puzzle that you have to solve.</p><p>One important thing to remember about Parsons Problems is that the correct solution depends not only on the order of the code snippets, but how they are indented as well. In programming languages such as Python, the way the code is indented has great meaning, as we’ll learn later in this course.</p><p>In addition, sometimes there may be more than one valid solution to a problem. There are times when the exact ordering of the code snippets is not as important as making sure some operations happen before others. So, you may find that there are multiple ways to get a correct answer to a problem.</p><p>Finally, many times a Parsons Problem will contain more code snippets than are actually needed to solve the problem. So, part of your work will be to figure out which pieces you need to solve the puzzle, and which pieces can be ignored. So, you may have to think carefully and not just use everything that is given to you by default.</p><p>Just like any other question in Codio, make sure you read the instructions carefully. We may give you hints about how to solve the problem, or whether there are extra pieces of code that can be ignored. You may also be given just one try to get it correct, or you may have multiple tries.
Let’s check out an example on this page. Instead of code, we’ll treat this like a numbered list, with some numbers having multiple items beneath them. Place the items in the correct order, and leave out the ones that say “Unused” since they aren’t part of the list. When you are done, your list should look like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-tex data-lang=tex><span class=line><span class=cl>1. Item 1
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>2. Item 2
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>3. Item 3
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    3.1. Item 3, Subitem 1
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    3.2. Item 3, Subitem 2
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>4. Item 4</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You’ll have unlimited attempts to get this question correct!</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cs-zero/js/clipboard.min.js?1756074754 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1756074754 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/theme.js?1756074754 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/embed-iframe.js?1756074754 defer></script></body></html>
