There are times when the exact ordering of the code snippets is not as important as making sure some operations happen before others. So, you may find that there are multiple ways to get a correct answer to a problem.</p><p>Finally, many times a Parsons Problem will contain more code snippets than are actually needed to solve the problem. So, part of your work will be to figure out which pieces you need to solve the puzzle, and which pieces can be ignored. So, you may have to think carefully and not just use everything that is given to you by default.</p><p>Just like any other question in Codio, make sure you read the instructions carefully. We may give you hints about how to solve the problem, or whether there are extra pieces of code that can be ignored. You may also be given just one try to get it correct, or you may have multiple tries.
Let’s check out an example on this page. Instead of code, we’ll treat this like a numbered list, with some numbers having multiple items beneath them. Place the items in the correct order, and leave out the ones that say “Unused” since they aren’t part of the list. When you are done, your list should look like this:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-tex data-lang=tex><span style=display:flex><span>1. Item 1
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>2. Item 2
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>3. Item 3
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    3.1. Item 3, Subitem 1
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    3.2. Item 3, Subitem 2
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>4. Item 4</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You’ll have unlimited attempts to get this question correct!</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cs-zero/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1768540833 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1768540833 defer></script><script src=/cs-zero/js/theme.min.js?1768540833 defer></script></div><script src=/cs-zero/js/tele-scroll.min.js?1768540833 defer></script></body></html>
