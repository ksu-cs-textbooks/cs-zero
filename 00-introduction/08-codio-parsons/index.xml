These problems are great ways to practice the logic of programming without having to remember how to type each line of code yourself. You can think of them like a puzzle that you have to solve.
One important thing to remember about Parsons Problems is that the correct solution depends not only on the order of the code snippets, but how they are indented as well.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-introduction/08-codio-parsons/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
