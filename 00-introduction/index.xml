Hello and welcome to the Computational Core program!
My name is Emily Alfs-Votipka, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus.
[Slide 2]
There are many other instructors and TAs for this program that you may interact with or see in the tutorial videos. They all have been instrumental in the development of this program.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Code.org Quotes Video Script Finally, before embarking on this program, let&amp;rsquo;s take a brief minute to review what you&amp;rsquo;ll learn by the time you complete the program.
Of course, the biggest and most impactful outcome will be learning how to write computer programs. Throughout the Computational Core program, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn either the Java or Python programming language, and get to a point where you are quite proficient with your language of choice.</description>

      <description>Resources K-State Honor &amp;amp; Integrity System Video Script &amp;ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&amp;rdquo; - K-State Honor Pledge
Plagiarism is a very serious concern in this course, and something that we do not take lightly. Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.</description>

      <title>Codio Parsons</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cs-zero/00-introduction/08-codio-parsons/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cs-zero/00-introduction/08-codio-parsons/</guid>
      <description>Another type of question included in Codio is a Parsons Problem, where you drag-and-drop snippets of code to build the solution to a problem. These problems are great ways to practice the logic of programming without having to remember how to type each line of code yourself. You can think of them like a puzzle that you have to solve.
One important thing to remember about Parsons Problems is that the correct solution depends not only on the order of the code snippets, but how they are indented as well.</description>

      <description>Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few pages in Codio, let&amp;rsquo;s take a minute to discuss some of the features of the Codio user interface. Of course, Codio has some amazing documentation, so feel free to check that out as you work with Codio.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the menu items at the top of the page. There are several available to you that are worth mentioning. For starters, you can click the Codio Icon at any time to go directly to your Codio dashboard.</description>

      <description>How to Get Help in this Course CC 110 can be an interesting course due to the large amount of material covered and much of the material is brand new to students. Therefore, you are encouraged to seek help whenever you feel you are being overwhelmed or don’t understand a topic. You are not alone! Most students in CC 110 have never studied anything relating to computer science before, so it is new to everyone.</description>
