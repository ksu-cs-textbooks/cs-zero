Hello and welcome to the Computational Core program!
My name is Emily Alfs-Votipka, and I’ll be one of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus.</description></item><item><title>Navigating Canvas &amp; Codio</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-introduction/02-navigating-canvas-codio/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-introduction/02-navigating-canvas-codio/index.html</guid><description>Resources Codio Documentation Video Script This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before.

Of course, the biggest and most impactful outcome will be learning how to write computer programs. Throughout the Computational Core program, you’ll learn either the Java or Python programming language, and get to a point where you are quite proficient with your language of choice. You’ll be capable of building your own programs from scratch to meet many of the challenges you’ll encounter in your career or elsewhere. This skill alone will set you well above your peers.</description></item><item><title>How to Learn Programming</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-introduction/05-how-to-learn-programming/index.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 00:53:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-introduction/05-how-to-learn-programming/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides The Science of Learning Programming from Nathan Bean’s CIS 400 Textbook The Power of Believing You Can Improve | Carol Dweck - TED Talk on Mindsets and the Power of “Yet” The New Science of Learning: How to Learn in Haromony with your Brain by Terry Doyle and Todd Zakrajsek - Great Book on Learning Constructivism on Wikipedia - Article about Jean Piaget’s Learning Philosophy Toward a Developmental Epistemology of Computer Programming by Raymond Lister - Introduces the Stages of Learning to Program Video Script Before we launch into the course itself, I wanted to take a few minutes to share some information with you regarding what we know about how students learn to program. This isn’t just anecdotal evidence from computer science teachers like me, but theories and research from education researchers who study how humans learn new skills and abilities throughout their lives.If I had to summarize all of this information in as few words as possible, I’d simply say “do the work.” Learning to program is difficult, and the only way to really get good at it is through constant practice and learning. However, that greatly oversimplifies the information that I want to share, and I’m hoping that you’ll find some helpful takeaways from this video that you can incorporate into your learning process.</description></item><item><title>CC 110 Syllabus - Fall 2024</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-introduction/06-cc110-syllabus/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/00-introduction/06-cc110-syllabus/index.html</guid><description>CC 110 - Introduction to Computing - Fall 2024 Previous Versions
Instructor Contact Information Professor: Dr. Safia Malallah (She/her)
Office: 2161 Engineering Hall (DUE) Office Hours: Check the calendar In person location: DUE 2161 Online : https://ksu.zoom.us/my/safiamalallah Want to meet with me outside office hours?: Schedule online Instructor: Safia Malallah I use she/her pronouns. Feel free to share your own pronouns with me, and I’ll do my best to use them! Email: Safia@ksu.edu and CC cc110-help@KSUemailProd.onmicrosoft.com>
Please avoid using the Canvas email functionality; instead, contact me directly at this email address. Canvas emails don’t always reach my inbox reliably.
I’d like to emphasize that I make an effort to respond to emails within 24 “business hours” (if you don’t receive a reply within 24 hours, please don’t hesitate to reach out again). Specifically, on Fridays, I can only respond until I need to attend to my kids, which means you can anticipate my reply on Monday. Therefore, it’s a good practice to reach out with your questions well in advance to ensure you have enough time to receive my response. Preferred Methods of Communication: Email: Please use “cc110-help” (cc110-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com if not on web-mail) for all communication regarding these courses as it allows instructors and TAs to provide a clear and detailed response, as well as easily store and record communication for reference later. You should receive a response within one business day, and hopefully much sooner. Note emailing the instructor or teaching assistants directly may result in longer wait times for your support.

Plagiarism is a very serious concern in this course, and something that we do not take lightly. Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.</description></item></channel></rss>
