Please avoid using the Canvas email functionality; instead, contact me directly at this email address. Canvas emails don’t always reach my inbox reliably.
I’d like to emphasize that I make an effort to respond to emails within 24 “business hours” (if you don’t receive a reply within 24 hours, please don’t hesitate to reach out again). Specifically, on Fridays, I can only respond until I need to attend to my kids, which means you can anticipate my reply on Monday. Therefore, it’s a good practice to reach out with your questions well in advance to ensure you have enough time to receive my response.
