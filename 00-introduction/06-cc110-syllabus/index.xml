Feel free to share your own pronouns with me, and I’ll do my best to use them! Email: Safia@ksu.edu and CC cc110-help@KSUemailProd.onmicrosoft.com>
Please avoid using the Canvas email functionality; instead, contact me directly at this email address. Canvas emails don’t always reach my inbox reliably.
I’d like to emphasize that I make an effort to respond to emails within 24 “business hours” (if you don’t receive a reply within 24 hours, please don’t hesitate to reach out again). Specifically, on Fridays, I can only respond until I need to attend to my kids, which means you can anticipate my reply on Monday. Therefore, it’s a good practice to reach out with your questions well in advance to ensure you have enough time to receive my response. Preferred Methods of Communication: Email: Please use “cc110-help” (cc110-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com if not on web-mail) for all communication regarding these courses as it allows instructors and TAs to provide a clear and detailed response, as well as easily store and record communication for reference later. You should receive a response within one business day, and hopefully much sooner. Note emailing the instructor or teaching assistants directly may result in longer wait times for your support.
