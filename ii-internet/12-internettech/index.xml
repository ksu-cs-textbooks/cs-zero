As we discussed in a previous video, early computer networks relied on circuit switching, where each computer had to have a direct connection to each other computer it needed to talk to. This was very cumbersome and very prone to error.</description></item><item><title>High Tech Heroes #32, part 1: Paul Baran</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/02-high-tech-heros/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/02-high-tech-heros/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>Protocols</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/03-protocols/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/03-protocols/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script The topmost layer of the seven layer OSI network model is the application layer. In this video, we’ll take a look at some application layer protocols and discuss what they do. These protocols are usually used to send data across two different computers using different programs. For example, there are protocols such as pop, SMTP, and eye map for sending and receiving email. We have HTTP and FTP for sending and receiving files and webpages using the World Wide Web.</description></item><item><title>Seven Layer OSI Model</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/04-seven-layers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/04-seven-layers/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script As we saw in the video, the work of Paul Bran led to the creation of packet switch networks, a packet switch network might look something like this diagram, we have three computers. But we actually have six network devices that are creating a complicated network infrastructure that connects these three devices. So looking at this diagram, can you see some advantages to this network setup.</description></item><item><title>The World Wide Web: Crash Course Computer Science #30</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/05-www-crash-course/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/05-www-crash-course/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item></channel></rss>
