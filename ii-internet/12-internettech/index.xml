As we discussed in a previous video, early computer networks relied on circuit switching, where each computer had to have a direct connection to each other computer it needed to talk to. This was very cumbersome and very prone to error. And so we needed to come up with a better system for doing this.</description></item><item><title>High Tech Heroes #32, part 1: Paul Baran</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/02-high-tech-heros/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/02-high-tech-heros/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Protocols</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/03-protocols/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/03-protocols/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script The topmost layer of the seven layer OSI network model is the application layer. In this video, we’ll take a look at some application layer protocols and discuss what they do. These protocols are usually used to send data across two different computers using different programs. For example, there are protocols such as pop, SMTP, and eye map for sending and receiving email. We have HTTP and FTP for sending and receiving files and webpages using the World Wide Web. We have DNS and DHCP for helping us configure and set up our networks. And we can use protocols such as SSH, RDP, or telnet to remotely connect to computer systems all across the globe. So let’s take a look at a few of these application layer protocols and see how they work.</description></item><item><title>Seven Layer OSI Model</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/04-seven-layers/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/04-seven-layers/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script As we saw in the video, the work of Paul Baran led to the creation of packet switch networks, a packet switch network might look something like this diagram, we have three computers. But we actually have six network devices that are creating a complicated network infrastructure that connects these three devices. So looking at this diagram, can you see some advantages to this network setup. For example, if one node goes down, can we still find a way to get a message to all the other nodes, it looks like we can in a lot of cases. So that makes this network very fault tolerance. In addition, if we want to add more computers to the network, we just have to plug them in at one of these open spots and they’ll be able to communicate as well. So packet switch network is really important. One of the key concepts in packet switch networking is routing. And routing is figuring out a way to create a path in the network to get from point A to point B using the shortest path which means Be the fewest number of hops, it really depends. And so with networking, if any one particular system goes down, our routing can actually figure out a way to get around that problem without any issues.</description></item><item><title>The World Wide Web: Crash Course Computer Science #30</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/05-www-crash-course/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/12-internettech/05-www-crash-course/index.html</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
