In this video we’re gonna be looking at JavaScript. But let’s look into some of the history behind it. To start, we’re going to talk about Brendan Eich. Brendan Eich was actually one of the people who co founded the Mozilla project to of course launching the major browser Firefox, but he’s also the creator of JavaScript. Eich had a master’s degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, but then he started working at Silicon Graphics, working about seven years or so on an operating systems project, and primarily a lot of networking code. But he then started at Netscape in 1995. And when he joined Netscape, he really intended to put the language called scheme into the web browsers. Now, Netscape, of course is no longer prevalent in today’s internet world, but Netscape was really primarily one of the leading internet companies back in the mid to late 90s. But as Brendan started to work and putting scheme into the web browser, Netscape noted that his project actually resembled the Java syntax, and pushed really quickly after after that point. His project released a little over a week later, to accommodate Netscape Navigator 2. And so he was really pushed really time pressed underneath, and a lot of pressure to get this language actually released. And it actually underwent many different name changes during that time. One point it was called mocha, then LiveScript, and then eventually called JavaScript all in the same month. While it does resemble Java, JavaScript itself is actually an entirely different category of programming language. While Java is very object oriented JavaScript is more of a as as it sounds, right, more of a scripting programming language designed specifically for the web.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/13-webprog/06-javascript/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
