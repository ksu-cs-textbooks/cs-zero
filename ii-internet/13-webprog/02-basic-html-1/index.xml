In this video, we’re going to continue our talk on HTML and start looking a little bit at HTML tags. As we mentioned before, the language itself works off of a series of tags, tags are denoted by a less than and greater than symbol with the name of the tag in between. Now, some tags may also actually have attributes in between there, but we’ll get to that later. To make a basic web page, we need four primary tags, HTML, head, and body. But we’ll also add in title there, so we can actually have a name for our webpage as well. The HTML tag primarily wraps the entire contents of the web page, although not all of those contents are actually displayed directly on the web page. For example, the head tag will actually have some meta information about the page, but it’s not actually rendered in the web browser, the title tag actually belongs to the head tag. And while it’s not rendered on the page, it’s actually going to denote the name of the webpage in things like your tabs. So when you open up a page in a new tab, and you have the name of the webpage, there, that’s where that comes from. The body tag is going to have all the rest of the content of the actual website.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/13-webprog/02-basic-html-1/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
