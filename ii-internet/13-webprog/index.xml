In this video, we’re going to be taking a look at the Hypertext Markup Language. This is a continuation of our previous videos where we talked about the history of the internet, as well as how the internet actually worked.

In this video, we’re going to continue our talk on HTML and start looking a little bit at HTML tags.

In this video, we’re gonna be taking a look at interactive web technologies. And now we’ve talked a lot about these things in the past about Web 1.0 vs 2.0. So going from the static plain HTML Web to Web 2.0, where everything is much more dynamic, interactive, more media, more content, more interactive technology. And so we’re going to take a look at how we can actually use some of these to make our websites a little bit more interesting.</description></item><item><title>Starting Tic Tac Toe</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/13-webprog/05-tictactoe-page/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/13-webprog/05-tictactoe-page/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Welcome back everyone.

In this video we’re gonna be looking at JavaScript. But let’s look into some of the history behind it. To start, we’re going to talk about Brendan Eich.
