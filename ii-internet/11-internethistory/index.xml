The history of the internet is a very interesting topic in computer science. But I think it’s one that we don’t think about very often today, we just take the internet for granted and just know that it’s always there. So let’s take a look at where the internet came from.</description></item><item><title>J.C.R.

C. R. Licklider his idea inspired him to write a paper in 1962 titled Man Computer Symbiosis. And in that paper, he had this quote, that he foresaw a network of such computers connected to one another by wideband communication lines, which could provide the functions of present day libraries together with anticipated advances in information storage and retrieval, and other symbiotic functions.</description></item><item><title>The first Internet connection, with UCLA's Leonard Kleinrock</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/07-first-connection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/07-first-connection/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>The History of the Internet (Part 3)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/08-part3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/08-part3/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script On October 29, 1969, the first message was transmitted across the newly created ARPANET between computers at UCLA and SRI, the Stanford Research Institute. And so in this particular picture, we see the notes from Leonard Kleinrock notebook taken on October 29, 1969, showing that they talked to SRI hosts to host and it was really revolutionary moment on the internet. Because this was the first instance of a packet switch network being used that now forms the basis of the internet.</description></item><item><title>Internet History part 4: Vint Cerf on the Birth of the Internet in 1983</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/09-vint-cerf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/09-vint-cerf/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>The History of the Internet (Part 4)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/10-part4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/10-part4/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script The technology that Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn developed is the transmission control protocol or TCP. TCP allows small networks to talk to each other using a common standard or protocol that determines how they actually interact. The biggest benefit of TCP is there’s no single point of failure in the system. They’re not all talking to a central hub, each computer can talk point to point or host a host and pass the packets along as needed to the next system.</description></item><item><title>World Wide Web Turns 25: Interview with inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/11-www-25th/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/11-www-25th/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>The History of the Internet (Part 5)</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/12-part5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/12-part5/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script In the previous video we saw mosaic as an example of one of the first web browsers. It’s really credited with bringing a large number of people to the web because they could easily install it on their personal computers at home. Mosaic was eventually sold to eventually became Netscape Navigator, which was then sold to a new company called Mozilla, and rebranded as Mozilla Firefox.</description></item><item><title>Line Mode Browser 2013</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/13-line-mode/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/13-line-mode/</guid><description>https://line-mode.cern.ch/</description></item><item><title>Dot-com Bubble on Wikipedia</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/14-dot-com-bubble/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/ii-internet/11-internethistory/14-dot-com-bubble/</guid><description>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble</description></item></channel></rss>
