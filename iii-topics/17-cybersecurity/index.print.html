Cyber Security is another important research area in computer science, and it&rsquo;s one that directly impacts a lot of computer users in their daily lives. So in cybersecurity, we really are asking ourselves one big question, how do we keep our data secure, and that&rsquo;s really all it comes down to. We&rsquo;re trying to secure data both on our computers, but also as we transmitted across the Internet, and any other communication technologies we might be using. And so we&rsquo;re going to talk about some different ways that we can keep our data secure on our computers.</p><p>Before we get into that, a word of warning, I&rsquo;m encouraging each of you to put your white hat on when we talk about this. So in computer science, we talk about different types of hackers. And typically, you have the black hat hackers, which are the ones that do so maliciously. But you can also have white hat hackers, which are hackers that use their skills for benevolent means– to help companies find security holes in their infrastructures and hopefully patch those holes and become a little bit safer. And so some of the things we&rsquo;re going to talk about today, if used maliciously, could be very illegal, they could be felonies, they&rsquo;re very, very dangerous things for you to use maliciously. But as a computer scientist, it&rsquo;s important for you to understand those topics so that you can defend against them and know what they are in case they get used against you. And so I&rsquo;m encouraging us all to put our white hats on at this point, and come at this topic from the view of doing this for the good of everybody else and trying to help them secure and protect their data. Okay, let&rsquo;s get started.</p><p>First, we need to talk about authentication. Authentication is a very, very important part of anything in cyber security. And authentication mainly deals with a few things, it&rsquo;s determining if the person is who they say they are. So when you sit down to a computer, and you type in your password, that is a form of authentication. You&rsquo;re letting your computer authenticate the fact that you are who you say you are. Now, typically, authentication requires three different factors. There are ownership factors, which is something the user has. For example, an ownership factor could be a physical key to a building, it could be a USB drive that has a token on it, or it could be some other symbol or some other device that the user has to authenticate that they are who they say they are. A police badge, for example, is a form of authentication that authenticates who that person is. The second one we can talk about is knowledge factors. A knowledge factor is something the user knows that authenticates themselves. Typically, we think of this as passwords and pin numbers or anything else the user has memorized. But it could be even other facts such as birth dates, and mother&rsquo;s maiden names, and social security numbers, things that the user would know very quickly. Those are what makes up a knowledge factor. And for most computer systems, we use knowledge factors as the primary form of authentication. The third form of authentication is an inherent factor. And an inherent factor is something the user inherently is. An inherent factor would be things such as a retinal scan, or a fingerprint scan, or DNA test, something that these are really can&rsquo;t change about themselves.</p><p>And so to authenticate a user in a computer system, we typically use one of these factors at a minimum to authenticate them. There is also something called multi factor authentication or two factor authentication, which you&rsquo;ve probably come across, especially if you do online banking or play certain video games. And that is pretty much exactly what you think it is, it is two different factors of authentication combined to provide greater security. And typically, they combine something the user knows, such as a password or a pin number ,with something the user has, such as a credit card, or in a lot of cases, it&rsquo;s access to a mobile phone or an email account. And that is something the user has or possesses as the second factor of authentication. So think about some places that you run into two factor authentication, video games, online banking. At K-State, a lot of faculty and staff now use two factor authentication whenever they authenticate at K-State. But a big question to ask yourself is, would you as a student like to have two factor authentication on your K-State account? Why or why not? Do you think it&rsquo;s worth the extra security to really protect all of your important academic records? Or is it just an extra hassle if you have to get your phone out every single time you want to log in? Currently, for faculty and staff, we log in with our phones, but then we can have it remember our device for up to 10 days before we have to do that two factor authentication again. So it&rsquo;s a little bit extra hassle, but it&rsquo;s not super inconvenient if we&rsquo;re using the same computer day after day. But I could see if you&rsquo;re using lab computers and have to authenticate every single time, that might be a little extra hassle for you. So it&rsquo;s something to think about.</p><p>So in this lecture, we&rsquo;re going to hone in on one of the most common authentication factors, which is the use of a password. A password is a very traditional system used to authenticate users on computer systems, on websites, just about anywhere. But I think there&rsquo;s a lot of misconceptions about how to make secure passwords and how secure passwords really are. And so we&rsquo;re going to rely on some information to really look at passwords and how they can be made more secure and some of the ways that they may be are less secure than we thought. So this is a comic from XKCD. It&rsquo;s one of the great comics that he does. And here, he&rsquo;s talking about how we make a particular password. And we&rsquo;re going to come back to this comic. But here he shows a pretty common password, we start with an uncommon, but non jibberish word, then we add like a number and a punctuation because almost every website, you need to have at least a number and a punctuation. And we do some common substitutions from leet speak so zeros for O&rsquo;s and fours for A&rsquo;s. Usually we have caps and 99% of the time, if you&rsquo;re going to capitalize the letter, it&rsquo;s going to be the first letter of your password. So what we have is we have a password here that has a few different bits of entropy. And in fact, if you calculate it out, there&rsquo;s just about 16 bits of entropy in this box. So that means that there are roughly 65,535 different ways that you could build a password. Based on these rules. You choose a word, you add some numbers, and punctuations, and substitutions and things. And so 16 bits of entropy, that sounds pretty powerful.</p><p>But how would we go about cracking this password? What would that look like? So let&rsquo;s look at some different ways you could possibly crack this password. Obviously, the first thing you could do is you could try brute force. You start with aaaaaa, that didn&rsquo;t work aaaaab, that didn&rsquo;t work, and so on. And so brute force hacking does work in certain scenarios, especially for things like combination locks. If you&rsquo;ve ever done a an escape room, one thing you might realize is they give you those combination locks with four dials on it. And hopefully, you&rsquo;re smart enough to realize that if you only get three of the four dials, and you can&rsquo;t quite figure out the fourth one, you could brute force it in about 10 seconds. So you really don&rsquo;t have to get all of the dials, you can just brute force a little bit. And so with combination locks and things, sometimes it&rsquo;s very, very easy to brute force them. And in fact was simple passwords like old websites that required your passwords to be eight characters or less, you could actually brute force a password very quickly. For example, here is a six character password, there would be about 308 million different six character all lowercase passwords. It seems like a lot, but if we try it about 1000 a second, which is pretty, pretty common. I mean, even on a bad website, you could try 1000 passwords a second, it would only take us about three and a half days to crack that password. And in the grand scheme of things, three and a half days is not that long.</p><p>So let&rsquo;s look at another way. How about things like rainbow tables. For example, this slide shows the 25 most common passwords used on the internet, according to some research done by Gizmodo a few years ago. And looking at this list, it is pretty disappointing. You&rsquo;ll see passwords such as 123456, or 123456789. But you&rsquo;ll see things like sunshine, qwerty, iloveyou, admin, abc123, certain profanity words. And so these passwords are really not all that great. And in fact, it&rsquo;s really easy to go online and find some of the most common passwords that are available. Another thing that we can look at is what&rsquo;s called rainbow tables. And so a rainbow table is actually a password lookup table that is calculated all of the protected versions of these passwords. For example, on older versions of Windows, when you set your windows password would actually be stored in the Windows registry using a hash. And so a hash, if you remember from our previous module is an algorithm that takes a piece of text and converts it to a number using a one way algorithm. And so the theory is if you type in the same password and go through the same hash algorithm, if you get the same output, you know, they put in the right password. But of course, what you could do is put in all possible passwords and store all of the possible hashes and create a table that matches them up. And so that&rsquo;s what a rainbow table is, it basically creates a rainbow of all the different possible password combinations and the hashes that those create. And so if you have a Windows computer, an older Windows computer and can get the password hash out of the registry, you can go online to these websites that have rainbow tables and just put in that hash, and they will look up the password for you or at least a password that creates that hash. And so for a lot of really bad algorithms such as the early windows algorithm, there are some algorithms such as MD5 that rainbow tables are created for, you could just go out and look up a password based on a hash.</p><p>So between brute forcing common passwords and rainbow tables, there are a lot of different ways that you can crack really easy passwords. So let&rsquo;s go back and look at that password example we saw earlier and talk about entropy. So he calculates that there would be about 28 bits of entropy in a common password there and 2 the 28 to get about three days at 1000 guesses a second. It&rsquo;s really similar to what we saw with brute forcing, even though it&rsquo;s a much longer more complex password, but it&rsquo;s actually pretty easy to break a password like that. Now, here&rsquo;s the hard part. Can you remember what that password was on that slide a few minutes ago? Don&rsquo;t Look, don&rsquo;t rewind the video and look, but see if you can write down that password that we saw earlier. Did you get it? Now you can go look and see if you got it. And so it turns out that we&rsquo;re creating passwords that are really easy to actually crack if we understand the structure of the password. But it&rsquo;s very hard for us to remember is it&rsquo;s troubadour with an & and a three, but I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what order so it&rsquo;s hard to remember.</p><p>And so what he&rsquo;s arguing here is we&rsquo;re creating passwords that are basically easy to crack and hard to remember, what we really should focus on is creating passwords that are hard to crack, but easy to remember. How do you suppose we would do that? It turns out that to make more complex passwords, there is exactly one rule that you need to follow. And that is make them longer. That&rsquo;s it. No special characters, no capitalization, punctuation, lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols, foreign words, does not matter. The only thing that matters to make your password more secure, is making it longer. So here we have four random common words, you start with 1000 common words in the English language. So that means you have about 10, or 11 bits of entropy per word. And you pick four of them correct horse battery staple. purple monkey umbrella dishwasher. very, very simple. All you have to remember is those four words, and I can even go out there and say, here&rsquo;s a list of 1000 words. And my password is four words separated by spaces. And that right there would have 44 bits of entropy. So even if I gave you the list of words and told you exactly how my password was set up, it could take you 550 years to try all possible combinations of that password at 1000 guesses a second. That is much, much harder to do. But it&rsquo;s very easy to remember, you probably already remember that password correct horse battery staple. It&rsquo;s very easy to remember.</p><p>And so the whole idea behind making secure passwords, we see a lot of websites today that tell you you have to have a number and a symbol and special characters and whatnot, doesn&rsquo;t matter. The only thing they should do is set a minimum password requirement of 20 or 30 characters and just tell you to make a long password. That right there will make your password more secure with a big asterisk on it. Understand that when we talk about security here, we&rsquo;re only talking about security based on cracking the password using some sort of brute force method or some sort of dictionary based method. We are not saying that that password is secure against all attacks, for example, correct horse battery staple, if you write that down on a post it note and stick it under your keyboard, it would only take somebody about two seconds to read that password off of the post a note and remember it instantly. There&rsquo;s nothing special about it. And so just because it&rsquo;s easy for you to remember doesn&rsquo;t mean that wouldn&rsquo;t also be easy for someone else to remember. Likewise, if you don&rsquo;t pick four random words, if you pick four words like your four grandparents or something like that, like their names, that could be much easier for people to crack. And so while it&rsquo;s uncrackable from a computer standpoint, there are other parts of cybersecurity that we&rsquo;ll get into a little bit later that make this password maybe less secure than what you want.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=storing-passwords>Storing Passwords</h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct5h7u-PD4o">YouTube Video</a><h4 id=resources>Resources</h4><ul><li><a href=/cs-zero/iii-topics/17-cybersecurity/slides/23-Cybersecurity.pdf>Slides</a></li></ul><h4 id=video-script>Video Script</h4><p>So finally, let&rsquo;s talk about storing passwords securely in your applications. And there are a lot of different ways you can store passwords so that users could use them to authenticate. Let&rsquo;s take a look at that. First, obviously, we could store the password itself. The user types in a password, we store that password in the database. Great, right? They type that password in again, we check it to make sure they typed in the same password. If they did, they let them in. That sounds like a really great system, doesn&rsquo;t it? Hopefully, you&rsquo;re cringing a little bit thinking about this. Because obviously, websites that have databases on them get hacked all the time. And if a hacker gets access to this database, they have your password. Simple as that. There&rsquo;s nothing that they have to do, there&rsquo;s no decryption they have to worry about, they get your password. And of course, one of the weaknesses of people on the internet is we tend to use the same password over and over again. Raise your hand, if you do that. I do. I use the same password a lot of places on the internet, it&rsquo;s something I probably shouldn&rsquo;t do. But I do. And so if somebody gets one of my passwords, they might be able to use that password to log into other websites that I use that same password on. So this is obviously not very secure. And the only thing that they need to compromise this is database access. As soon as they access the database, they have all the passwords, and it&rsquo;s really simple so we probably shouldn&rsquo;t do this.</p><p>What if we store the passwords by encrypting them using a key? Well, that makes them a little bit more secure, which means now if you get the database, you also need to have a key to decrypt the passwords, or of course, some sort of a lookup table or a rainbow table to decrypt the passwords. And so you know, as soon as they get the database in the key, it would compromise all the accounts. So this is better than storing the raw passwords. But it&rsquo;s still not great. And it&rsquo;s not that hard. T</p><p>he really best way to store passwords is using what&rsquo;s called a password salt. And this is because users are generally bad at creating good passwords. And so what we can do is take their short, crappy passwords and add a long string of random characters to it before we encrypt it. And so that will make the encrypted password much much stronger, it will feel like a longer password, even if the user&rsquo;s portion of that password is very short. So it protects against all sorts of things like dictionary rainbow table attacks, Rainbow table attacks assume that passwords are pretty short. Most rainbow tables only work on passwords that are 10 characters or less. So if we add a salt of 25 characters to the end of a password, we&rsquo;re guaranteed to get something that&rsquo;s pretty long and hard to break using just standard encryption attacks. So if we store with a global salt, which means that we use the global salt value, the same salt value for all passwords, then a hacker would have to get the database, the encryption key we used, and that global salt value. And the nice thing is those are typically stored in three different places. The database is stored, obviously, as the database. The encryption key is probably stored somewhere in the software, and the salt value is probably stored somewhere in the software&rsquo;s configuration. And so you need to get all three of those parts to break these passwords. If you didn&rsquo;t have the encryption key or the salt value, you could try and brute force it, but it would take a long time. The downside is once you brute force a password, you could get the key and the salt and use that to compromise all the other accounts. So if you get one, you still get all the accounts compromised, but it is a little bit harder to do. The other thing you can do, of course, is you can encrypt all the passwords with a unique salt value. So every single user, every single account gets its own salt value. And if you do that, you need the database encryption key and the salt value for each user account in order to crack it. And that makes it even much harder. That means you can only compromise one account at a time, because every single time you need to get that salt value for that account. And so that makes cracking these passwords really, really hard to do.</p><p>So lastly, let&rsquo;s take a look at one of the instances where people have really broken passwords very, very quickly. And this is from the Adobe hack from several years ago. And again, this is an XKCD comic. But what happened is Adobe misused an algorithm called block mode ds. And what that does is every block of your password gets chunked up. So every eight characters or so it gets broken, and it gets encrypted separately. And because they did that incorrectly, if the user had the same password in that first eight characters, it would encrypt to the same thing. And so what you end up with is basically the world&rsquo;s largest crossword puzzle. So for example here you would have weathervanessword and then you have name one. If you&rsquo;re a fan of redwall, you might understand that weathervanessword might have something to do with Matthias from redwall and so this might be Mateus1. Here you have favorite of the 12 people apostles - Matthais, and then you have all these other ones like alphaobviousmichaeljackson. I&rsquo;m guessing this is ABC123- the famous Michael Jackson hit from when he was in the Jackson5. It&rsquo;s an obvious password, and it&rsquo;s alphabetical. So there are lots of different examples of bad passwords, being stored improperly not correctly salting and hashing them like you should and this is one that Adobe definitely got called out for back in the day. So finally, if you want to take a look at your own passwords and see how secure they are, there&rsquo;s this website howsecureismypassword.net. You can go online you can type in your passwords and it will give you an idea of how long it would take to crack that password.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=social-engineering>Social Engineering</h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbVpafg_AdU">YouTube Video</a><h4 id=resources>Resources</h4><ul><li><a href=/cs-zero/iii-topics/17-cybersecurity/slides/23-Cybersecurity.pdf>Slides</a></li></ul><h4 id=video-script>Video Script</h4><p>Another area of cybersecurity that we should discuss is social engineering. Social engineering is all about using techniques to compromise the system by exploiting the users directly instead of the system security itself. And this is a really important concept. There&rsquo;s an old saying, in computer science that a system is only as secure as the users that use that system. It&rsquo;s kind of a play off the idea of a system is only as secure as its weakest link. And in most cases, the weakest link is the user itself. And so on the next few slides, we&rsquo;re going to take a look at some different ways that you can use social engineering, to maybe break into a computer system and what those things look like so that we can defend against those. So a great example of social engineering is trying to get some information from somebody that they don&rsquo;t want to give. And a great example of that would be a bank account number. So if I wanted to get someone&rsquo;s bank account number, how do you think I could go about that using social engineering? Take a minute to think about it. So while this example may not work that well in today&rsquo;s world, because not many people carry around checkbooks. If you have a checkbook, look at your checkbook at the bottom of your checks, and see what&rsquo;s printed there. Hopefully, you should realize that printed at the bottom of your checks are two numbers. One of them is the routing number that identifies your bank, and the other number is your bank account number. And so I think one of the best ways to do this was actually discovered by Gru in the movie Despicable Me selling cookies. He had his girls sell Girl Scout cookies, and as long as he said, &ldquo;Oh, I can only accept checks.&rdquo; A lot of people might not think twice about writing a check for a Girl Scout troop, but that check includes your bank account information. And so with a little bit more work, you could probably use that information very nefariously against the people that wrote those checks. So even though it&rsquo;s something that we don&rsquo;t really think about giving out very often, it&rsquo;s right there out in the open if we know how to get it.</p><p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at some examples of social engineering and see what those look like. First and foremost is the idea of pretexting. Pretexting is calling or going somewhere and pretending to be someone else. And you see this a lot of times done in movies where the bad guys will come in and pretend to be exterminators so that they can gain access to the back room of a bank. But you could do it just as easily by calling someone and pretending to be their insurance agent. This happens at K-State all the time. Department offices get calls asking for information, like who&rsquo;s in charge?, who&rsquo;s the department head?, who buys your supplies? And then they will call back later and say, Oh, yeah, so and so said that you should buy the supplies from our company. We&rsquo;re just checking the follow up on the order. Even though no order was made. they now know who&rsquo;s in charge, who makes the decisions, and they&rsquo;re hoping that they get somebody else that is like, oh, yeah, that sounds reasonable. And they&rsquo;ll just approve it. So by pretexting a little bit, you can gain access to systems that may not work very well, otherwise. Of course, pretexting is very closely related to impersonation. Impersonation is calling is simply pretending to be somebody else. So with impersonating, I could impersonate one of my students, I can impersonate somebody else and try and get access to their systems. And this also happens every once in a while. For example, there were a couple of instances in the news where somebody got a call from somebody pretending to be their boss&rsquo;s secretary, and giving them new instructions for how to transfer money. And as soon as they transferred the money, of course, they were transferring it to the attackers, and the money was gone before they even realized what was going on. And of course, that person immediately realized their mistake called their boss directly to double check on the transfer. And obviously, the boss had no idea what was going on, and the money was already gone. And so impersonation is another really strong attack vector in social engineering.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also something called the human buffer overflow. So take a minute and try and read every single word on this page using the color that the word is written in. So it would start with green, red, blue, yellow, blue, black. You have to think about it. And in fact, if you try and go really, really fast, you&rsquo;ll probably find that you start reading the words instead of saying the colors. This is an example of the human buffer overflow. And so what you can do is by desensitizing people by getting them thinking about other things, you can trick them into saying something or revealing something they wouldn&rsquo;t normally do. A great way to do this is to have people do a few math problems, such as asking them what&rsquo;s two plus two? What&rsquo;s four plus four? What&rsquo;s eight plus eight? What&rsquo;s 16 plus 16? And then ask them to name a vegetable. And for a lot of humans, they will immediately answer carrot. Likewise, if you ask them to name a tool, it will probably be a hammer. If you ask them to name a number between five and 12. It will be seven. Seriously try this get some people to do some math problems and get them thinking logically and then ask them some of those random questions. And I think you&rsquo;ll be really surprised if they don&rsquo;t take a minute to think about it. Their knee jerk reactions are probably carrots, hammer, seven. It&rsquo;s worth trying. So that&rsquo;s one thing you can do.</p><p>Another one is definitely quid pro quo. This is a ransom attack. Very famously here in Kansas City, the company, Garmin, was recently attacked by ransomware. And so that&rsquo;s a quid pro quo attack, they took something they encrypted all of their systems, and then basically held it for ransom and said, if you don&rsquo;t give us money, we will not decrypt the systems. And so quid pro quo is a very, very powerful attack that is gaining a lot of popularity out there. You&rsquo;ve seen it done to governments, to hospitals, to large companies. It can be really devastating if they don&rsquo;t have the proper techniques in place to deal with such an attack.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s a lot more mundane ways that social engineering can happen to. You can have phishing attacks. This is a phishing attack that I got a few years ago from K-State, or at least it looked like it&rsquo;s from K state, asking us to send some information. So let&rsquo;s take a look at this email and see what we think. So first, we see that we got this email from <a href=mailto:accountupgrade@ksu.edu rel=external target=_blank>accountupgrade@ksu.edu</a>. It looks pretty legit. It comes from the Kansas State University webmail team. Yeah, that looks right. But then we start reading &ldquo;due to the congestion in all ksu.edu users and removal of all ksu.edu capital accounts copyright Kansas State University be shutting down&rdquo;. If you start reading this email, it doesn&rsquo;t really quite jive. It doesn&rsquo;t have really good English in it. And then of course, at the bottom, the obvious thing is to ask you for your first name, last name, email address, your username, your password, your password again, just to make sure you got it right, and your eID. And this is kind of interesting. Most people outside of case they don&rsquo;t even know what an ID is something that&rsquo;s unique to K-State, but they at least knew to ask for that particular question here. Although the ID, the username, and your email address are all going to be the same thing. So while this is a pretty good phishing attempt, it&rsquo;s not a great one. But every year these phishing attempts, they can compromise hundreds of casing email accounts every single year.</p><p>Likewise, you get these scams, these are known as 419 scams, but you get these all the time. Usually, it&rsquo;s something where they say that you have won some large amount of money, and they need some information from you to send it to you. And a lot of times they only ask for a few thousand dollars. They&rsquo;re called 419 scams, because that&rsquo;s the section of the Nigerian criminal code that makes these illegal. And a lot of these are at least said to originate from Nigeria. This one is from Ivory Coast. And this also is a real one that I received a few years ago when I put on these slides. And so this is a form of what&rsquo;s called advance fee fraud. They claim to have a large amount of money that they want to send to you, but they can&rsquo;t quite do it. And so they need you to send just a little bit of money to them so that they can get your money and send it back. Obviously, all of these are fake. But there are many stories online that you can find people that have been scammed for several thousands of dollars or 10s of thousands of dollars by scams, such as this.</p><p>Another form of social engineering you might run into is baiting. Baiting is leaving something out there and hoping somebody goes for it. And a great example of this is flash drives. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re walking across campus and you find a flash drive like this laying by the sidewalk. What&rsquo;s your first instinct? Do you pick it up and take it to the nearest computer and plug it in and see if you can figure out whose it is? Well, if you did that, you might have just infected that computer with a virus that was put on this flash drive. And this is actually a really common form of social engineering. In fact, this has been used as a white hat technique to protect a lot of companies and companies routinely fail this. They put a few flash drives out in the parking lot. A person finds a flash drive. &ldquo;Oh, I should be a good person and see who this is.&rdquo; And they immediately infect their company with a virus. And so when you find flash drives like this, especially flash drives that you don&rsquo;t know where they came from, the best thing you should do is give them to an IT professional and let them deal with it. A lot of times they have systems specifically set up so that they can plug in unknown data devices and make sure that they&rsquo;re done securely, and won&rsquo;t infect the system.</p><p>And then of course, it&rsquo;s also important to mention that social engineering does include threats, this XKCD comic once again, does a really good job of describing this. Crypto nerd might think, oh, we&rsquo;ve got a computer encrypted with a password, let&rsquo;s build a million dollar cluster to crack it. But in actuality, let&rsquo;s go get a $5 wrench and just beat this guy over the head with it until he gives us his password. And so you really have to understand tha while there are a lot of very sophisticated systems to protect our computer systems. Sometimes direct threats are something that you have to think about. And that&rsquo;s something that is really kind of uncomfortable to even think about in the field of cybersecurity. But it&rsquo;s something to bear in mind that sometimes a direct threat like that is enough to crack a system.</p><p>So now that we&rsquo;ve talked about all these different ways that social engineering can happen, let&rsquo;s talk about some ways that we can combat social engineering. First and foremost is user training. We need to do a really good job of training our users how to spot these scams. And this happens all the time. You have to train them how to watch for phishing scams and email scams. You have to train people to talk on the phone to listen for phone calls that are trying to solicit more information or trying to fake something out. You have to ask them to be questioning if somebody walks in and claims to be an exterminator. Who called them? Do they have an invoice? Do they have an appointment? Are we expecting you? things like that. All of those fall under user training, we also need to have really good security protocols and audits. We need to make sure that if there is something secure, that we keep it secure. And a security protocol could be as simple as if you&rsquo;re in a building where you have to swipe your key card to walk in the door, you don&rsquo;t hold the door open for somebody else. That&rsquo;s a great form of social engineering is standing outside smoking, and then being like, oh, I forgot my badge can you let me in? And if they&rsquo;re not thinking about the protocol, they&rsquo;re just like, sure, I&rsquo;ll let you in, and you&rsquo;ve just gained access to a secure building. So having those protocols and audits in place is also really important. As we mentioned earlier, as a user, you should always be a little skeptical, you should always be questioning everything. If you get an email that looks weird, a phone call that looks weird, somebody comes in and is acting suspicious, that little bit of questioning and being on guard can really protect you against a lot of social engineering. You can also perform penetration testing, a lot of companies do this where they will send out fake scam emails, and then anybody that responds to that email has to go through a security training. They can hire companies to try to come in as white hats, and try and break into the building, or talk their way in, or do all sorts of these cool things. And so by penetration testing, you can find those weaknesses in your protocols and make sure that you secure those. Finally, you can also work on properly disposing your garbage. Obviously a lot of social engineering can involve dumpster diving. You pull papers and invoices and things out of the trash. And so if you&rsquo;re not thinking about that, that can be one way that people can gain a lot of information about your company. And so if you&rsquo;re even at home, you should be shredding your bank statements or credit card statements cutting up your own credit cards, just in case because there&rsquo;s a lot of information that can be gotten just from a trash bag that&rsquo;s left outside.</p><p>So finally, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about social engineering in practice. Every year there is a DEF CON cybersecurity convention that&rsquo;s held every year in Las Vegas. And several years they have done what they call a capture the flag style contest. And the whole idea is contestants at that contest try and gain information about companies via the internet first. And then using that information, they will just call the company headquarters and attempt to gain more information or flags for points. And those five could be as simple as what web browser do you use? What version of Windows do you use to who&rsquo;s your exterminator company? who&rsquo;s your catering company? All of these pieces of information can be used to construct a really in depth social engineering attack on a company. And so the report is actually quite staggering how a lot of different companies did really, really poorly at this. Obviously part of DEF CON is they went out and asked these companies for permission. Nobody gave them permission to do this. They did it anyway. That&rsquo;s kind of how DEF CON works. So if you&rsquo;re interested, I encourage you to read the report. We will link it after this video. It&rsquo;s really quite fascinating to see what they were able to learn by doing social engineering.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=defcon-social-engineering-ctf-report>DEFCON Social Engineering CTF Report</h1><embed src=https://www.social-engineer.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DC21_SECTF_Final.pdf type=application/pdf width=100% height=800px><footer class=footline></footer></article></section></div></main><div class=git-footer><p class=theme-version-footer>6.0.0</p><p>Last modified by:
