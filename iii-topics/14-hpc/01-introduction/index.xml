I’m Dr. Dan Andresen. I’m the director of our K-State Supercomputing center, also a professor in computer science. So if you want to see me come by my office or set up a Zoom meeting, happy to talk about this sort of thing. So supercomputing is about two things. It’s about size. And it’s about speed. And compared to your average laptop, the laptop is the teeny mouse, so it’s about two big things. And it’s about size, because many problems just can’t fit into a standard laptop or standard desktop. And see if this issue of Okay, my problem is too big for that, what do I do? You take it to a supercomputer. Or similarly, if you’ve got a big problem that just takes way too long, or you got a little problem, and you get lots and lots of them, then it’s really useful to have something that isn’t likely to go ahead and say, Oh, yeah, by the way, I’m going to restart it every couple weeks, because Microsoft pushed out a patch, or something like that. And so these are the types of problems that we do on a supercomputer because with a supercomputer, we bring the size, we bring the speed so that if you’ve got really big problems, they’re actually manageable.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/14-hpc/01-introduction/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
