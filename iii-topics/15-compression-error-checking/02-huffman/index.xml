Huffman coding uses the frequency of the letters in a piece of text to reduce the amount of space that they take up in the encoded data. To do this, we will count the occurrences of each character in our text. And we’ll use that count to make a binary tree with the data. Then the paths of the tree to each character give the codes that we use for the Huffman encoded data. This is a little bit complex.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/02-huffman/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
