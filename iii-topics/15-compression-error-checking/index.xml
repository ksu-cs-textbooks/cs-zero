We’ve already talked about compression a little bit in the data encoding module earlier this semester. But now we’re going to spend an entire module talking about just these two topics. First, we’re going to talk about in compression. What do you think compression is and why do you think it’s useful? As you might recall, compression is reducing the amount of space a particular piece of data needs to be stored on a computer. And if we think about that, that may not even really make sense, how can we take the piece of data and store it in fewer Bits and Bytes than what it originally was? It turns out, there are a lot of different ways to do that. We can do all sorts of different things by replacing repeated chunks of data or re-encoding the data in such a way that we can interpret it differently in our computer systems. And we’ll take a look at that in this module.</description></item><item><title>Compression - Huffman Coding</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/02-huffman/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/02-huffman/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Next, let’s take a look at another form of compression called Huffman coding. Huffman coding uses the frequency of the letters in a piece of text to reduce the amount of space that they take up in the encoded data. To do this, we will count the occurrences of each character in our text. And we’ll use that count to make a binary tree with the data. Then the paths of the tree to each character give the codes that we use for the Huffman encoded data. This is a little bit complex.</description></item><item><title>Error Checking - Pinpoint</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/03-pinpoint/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/03-pinpoint/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Now let’s talk about error checking. What do you think error checking means when we’re talking about sending and retrieving data? And why do you think it would be useful? Well, let’s take a look at an example. When we send data, such as this text, hello there, sometimes the data might get garbled in transmission. When you were a kid, if you played with radios or walkie talkies, or anything like that, you might have had trouble understanding what other people say, Heck, even it happens today, sometimes on cell phone calls. So if there was a way that we could confirm that the data we’re receiving is the data that was actually sent without adding too much overhead to the data, that might be a really powerful tool, a great intuition to think of is squeezing the data into a smaller space, and then using that to check and see if we got the right answer.</description></item><item><title>Error Checking - Fletcher's Checksum</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/04-fletcher/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/04-fletcher/index.html</guid><description>Errata The C2 total on the slide at 0:54 - 2:10 is incorrect. The total is 7336 but that value modulo 255 is 196, not 96 as shown in the video.
Resources Slides Video Script Let’s look at an even better way to do a checksum to check and see if our data is correct. This is called Fletcher’s checksum. And here we’re giving a quick pseudocode of the algorithm that is used to generate Fletcher’s checksum. Basically, the way it works is you divide the word into a sequence of equally sized blocks. And we’ll just use the individual characters for this. And we’ll start with two checksums, one of them, C1 starts at zero, the other to also starts at zero, then for every block, we’ll add the value of the block to the first check sum. And then we’ll add the new value of that checksum to the second checksum. And then finally, while we’re done, we will calculate the values of the checksum mod 255 to reduce them to an eight bit binary value. And we’ll return those two checksums.</description></item><item><title>Error Checking - Other Methods</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/05-other-methods/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/05-other-methods/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Let’s go over a couple other error checking methods that you might run across, we’re not going to go into these in too much detail because they are kind of complex at this level. But we’ll give you an idea of what’s out there, just so you can say you’ve seen it. One interesting example is the cyclic redundancy check or CRC. With CRC will have some sort of binary value. And we’ll use a particular checksum to verify it. So we’ll start with this binary value on a checksum. And we will compute the XOR of the checksum, and that binary value. So we start with 1010. And we XOR that with 1011. So we’ll get 1. And this works a lot like long division, we just keep working down the value until we get left with something that is smaller than our checksum. And so with this input 101000001001, we would send along these three bits 011 as our checksum. And then once we’ve received it, we can do this same division again, and make sure that we get the same checksum to know that the error hasn’t been introduced in our code.</description></item><item><title>Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future Ch 1 - Introduction</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/06-9algs-intro/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/06-9algs-intro/index.html</guid><description>Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future Ch 1 - Introduction</description></item><item><title>Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future Ch 5 - Error Correcting Codes</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/07-9algs-ch5/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/07-9algs-ch5/index.html</guid><description>Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future Ch 5 - Error Correcting Codes</description></item><item><title>Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future Ch 7 - Data Compression</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/08-9algs-ch7/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/08-9algs-ch7/index.html</guid><description>Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future Ch 7 - Data Compression</description></item></channel></rss>
