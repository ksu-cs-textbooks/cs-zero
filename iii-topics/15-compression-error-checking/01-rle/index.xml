We’ve already talked about compression a little bit in the data encoding module earlier this semester. But now we’re going to spend an entire module talking about just these two topics. First, we’re going to talk about in compression. What do you think compression is and why do you think it’s useful? As you might recall, compression is reducing the amount of space a particular piece of data needs to be stored on a computer. And if we think about that, that may not even really make sense, how can we take the piece of data and store it in fewer Bits and Bytes than what it originally was? It turns out, there are a lot of different ways to do that. We can do all sorts of different things by replacing repeated chunks of data or re-encoding the data in such a way that we can interpret it differently in our computer systems. And we’ll take a look at that in this module.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/15-compression-error-checking/01-rle/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
