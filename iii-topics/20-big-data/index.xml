In this video series, we’re going to be taking a look at big data. So exactly how big is big data? So here’s a slide of the metric prefixes. And so which ones do you think constitute as big data? or big data? Today, we’re talking about data anywhere from gigabytes to petabytes and beyond. And the future, we may even be dealing with exabytes of data.</description></item><item><title>HealthMap.org</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/20-big-data/03-health-map/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/20-big-data/03-health-map/</guid><description>HealthMap</description></item><item><title>Google Trends</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/20-big-data/04-google-trends/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/20-big-data/04-google-trends/</guid><description>Google Trends</description></item><item><title>The Four V's</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/20-big-data/05-four-vs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/20-big-data/05-four-vs/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script To really understand how big data can be useful, we can look at four different aspects that are usually referred to as the four V’s of big data. These are volume. So how much data there is a variety, how much or how little variety actually exist, velocity, just how fast data is being produced and or received. And veracity. How accurate is that data, there’s also a fifth fee, typically referred to as value.</description></item><item><title>Map Reduce</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/20-big-data/06-map-reduce/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/20-big-data/06-map-reduce/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script One of the last things I want to talk about here with big data is some of the algorithms that we can actually use to work with this sheer amount of information. So one that I want to highlight here is called MapReduce. Oh, MapReduce is a very well known algorithm and big data realm. And now it’s been, of course, transformed significantly, since its original inception, inception, to handle even larger amounts of information.</description></item></channel></rss>
