      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Welcome back everyone. In this video series, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be taking a look at big data. So exactly how big is big data? So here&amp;rsquo;s a slide of the metric prefixes. And so which ones do you think constitute as big data? or big data? Today, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about data anywhere from gigabytes to petabytes and beyond. And the future, we may even be dealing with exabytes of data.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Video Script To really understand how big data can be useful, we can look at four different aspects that are usually referred to as the four V&amp;rsquo;s of big data. These are volume. So how much data there is a variety, how much or how little variety actually exist, velocity, just how fast data is being produced and or received. And veracity. How accurate is that data, there&amp;rsquo;s also a fifth fee, typically referred to as value.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Video Script One of the last things I want to talk about here with big data is some of the algorithms that we can actually use to work with this sheer amount of information. So one that I want to highlight here is called MapReduce. Oh, MapReduce is a very well known algorithm and big data realm. And now it&amp;rsquo;s been, of course, transformed significantly, since its original inception, inception, to handle even larger amounts of information.</description>
