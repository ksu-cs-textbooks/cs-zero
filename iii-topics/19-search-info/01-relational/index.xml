In this video, we’re going to be taking a look at information retrieval. But before we get to that point, we need to start talking about databases and how data is actually stored. So for this example, we’re going to be working on our own social network called K-Stater. Specifically, we’ve been asked to help design a way to keep track of all the data on a site, like a social network, like K-Stater should have. So if you take a few minutes and brainstorm what kind of data or imagine what kind of information we may need, for example, of course, we’ll need to have some sort of way to track our users like maybe your eID, name, birthday, major, and maybe even just your phone number. And, you know, of course, we’ll need a lot of other information to make a full website like this work. But we can start off with the basics right, just keeping track of our users. But since we want to keep track of all that information, we need some way to actually store it. And so there’s tons of different ways that we could actually store that on our computers, right, of how our computer systems are designed to store information in that way.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/19-search-info/01-relational/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
