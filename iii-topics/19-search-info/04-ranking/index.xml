In this video, we’re going to be taking a deeper look into what kind of queries we can actually ask of Google or searching the web. So we’ve already looked at simple queries like cat, dog, or cat and dog, or cat or dog. But that’s really not as interesting of a question to ask of the internet, right? When we’re wanting to find all of the webpages that are about cats, not just have the occurrences of the word cat, but are about cats. And so how do you know which web pages are more likely to be about cats and webpages that are more likely to be about dogs? And how could you tell the difference? And how would you modify our search algorithm that we had talked about earlier to account for that. So this ranking of the internet becomes a little bit more complicated than our simple straight up text queries.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/19-search-info/04-ranking/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
