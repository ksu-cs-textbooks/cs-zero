      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Welcome back everyone. In this video, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be taking a look at information retrieval. But before we get to that point, we need to start talking about databases and how data is actually stored. So for this example, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be working on our own social network called K-Stater. Specifically, we&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to help design a way to keep track of all the data on a site, like a social network, like K-Stater should have.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Video Script So in this video, we&amp;rsquo;re going to reiterate a little bit what we talked about with our relational database, right? Because the whole point of the relational database is that we can store lots of information in a very structured way that is easily searchable. That&amp;rsquo;s really important in today&amp;rsquo;s world, because we have the World Wide Web, right, the internet, it&amp;rsquo;s huge. Now that we know how to store data in a reasonable fashion, we have to talk about where most of the data in the world is actually stored.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Welcome back. In this video, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be taking a deeper look into what kind of queries we can actually ask of Google or searching the web. So we&amp;rsquo;ve already looked at simple queries like cat, dog, or cat and dog, or cat or dog. But that&amp;rsquo;s really not as interesting of a question to ask of the internet, right? When we&amp;rsquo;re wanting to find all of the webpages that are about cats, not just have the occurrences of the word cat, but are about cats.</description>
