And so one of the problems with AI is that it forces the computer to mimic all human behavior, not just intelligence. And so when we start to create an AI for it to truly be human like, right, it has to do all of our own behavior. And so things like slow response times, typos, commonly misheld conceptions that aren’t true, connecting words like I’m doing right now. All of these things are human behavior that may not be considered intelligent, or clean, or you know “perfect”, but it’s something that a successful AI agent must be able to do in order to pass what we call the Turing test. And we’ll talk about that here in a second. But likewise, an AI must also act, sometimes really, as if it can’t solve some problems that are perfectly well within its abilities to actually be able to solve, but simply because those problems are unsolvable by human intelligence or unsolvable in the amount of time it could take the AI or computer to actually solve. So if you’re trying to make an AI that is trained to behave and act like a human, it needs to do as humans do, and it can’t be perfect.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/04-machine-intelligence/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
