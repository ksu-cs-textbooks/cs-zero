In this video, we’re going to be taking a look at artificial intelligence. But before we get to the artificial part, what is actually intelligence? So what does it mean to be intelligent? This is a question I ask all of my students from the kindergarteners that I do outreach with all the way up into college classes like this, and I get a very wide range of responses here. And usually the default answer that I get is intelligent means someone is smart, right? But it’s not necessarily always the case, right? A person who’s smart or has an high IQ is capable of doing math, really good at remembering information, and creation of information. But it’s not necessarily intelligent behavior. So intelligence involves a lot of different things, including reasoning and problem solving, which of course, smart people are able to do those things as well. Our ability to reason to a certain degree and problem solved to a certain degree is definitely an intelligent behavior. When you encounter a situation in you’re environment, and you reason and solve that particular problem to get around that particular obstacle. And we see these types of behaviors and all sorts of beings, right? Not just humans, but it is documented quite frequently in the animal kingdom as well. Intelligent behavior also involves our ability to construct knowledge, right? So as we learn from our environment, right? Learning is also another intelligent behavior. But as we start to interact from our environment, we’re going to gather data, information, things that we see, taste, hear, touch, all of those things, our ability to perceive from our environment, which is also an intelligent behavior, our senses, but that information needs to go somewhere, right? An intelligent being like an animal or human is going to be able to take that information and construct knowledge to a certain degree.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/02-intelligence/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
