In this video, we’re going to be taking a look at artificial intelligence. But before we get to the artificial part, what is actually intelligence? So what does it mean to be intelligent? This is a question I ask all of my students from the kindergarteners that I do outreach with all the way up into college classes like this, and I get a very wide range of responses here. And usually the default answer that I get is intelligent means someone is smart, right? But it’s not necessarily always the case, right? A person who’s smart or has an high IQ is capable of doing math, really good at remembering information, and creation of information. But it’s not necessarily intelligent behavior. So intelligence involves a lot of different things, including reasoning and problem solving, which of course, smart people are able to do those things as well. Our ability to reason to a certain degree and problem solved to a certain degree is definitely an intelligent behavior. When you encounter a situation in you’re environment, and you reason and solve that particular problem to get around that particular obstacle. And we see these types of behaviors and all sorts of beings, right? Not just humans, but it is documented quite frequently in the animal kingdom as well. Intelligent behavior also involves our ability to construct knowledge, right? So as we learn from our environment, right? Learning is also another intelligent behavior. But as we start to interact from our environment, we’re going to gather data, information, things that we see, taste, hear, touch, all of those things, our ability to perceive from our environment, which is also an intelligent behavior, our senses, but that information needs to go somewhere, right? An intelligent being like an animal or human is going to be able to take that information and construct knowledge to a certain degree.</description></item><item><title>John McCarthy (1927-2011): Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/03-john-mcarthy/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/03-john-mcarthy/index.html</guid><description>Watch through 5:38</description></item><item><title>Are Machines Intelligent?</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/04-machine-intelligence/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/04-machine-intelligence/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script But let’s continue our talk here a little bit more about intelligent behavior and what that means with human behavior as well, and when we’re trying to actually make AI that seems human. And so one of the problems with AI is that it forces the computer to mimic all human behavior, not just intelligence. And so when we start to create an AI for it to truly be human like, right, it has to do all of our own behavior. And so things like slow response times, typos, commonly misheld conceptions that aren’t true, connecting words like I’m doing right now. All of these things are human behavior that may not be considered intelligent, or clean, or you know “perfect”, but it’s something that a successful AI agent must be able to do in order to pass what we call the Turing test. And we’ll talk about that here in a second. But likewise, an AI must also act, sometimes really, as if it can’t solve some problems that are perfectly well within its abilities to actually be able to solve, but simply because those problems are unsolvable by human intelligence or unsolvable in the amount of time it could take the AI or computer to actually solve. So if you’re trying to make an AI that is trained to behave and act like a human, it needs to do as humans do, and it can’t be perfect.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Agents</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/05-intelligent-agents/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/05-intelligent-agents/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Differentiation here between strong and weak AI starts to lead to the idea of intelligent agents. Intelligent agents are entities that can perceive things about its environment through sensors and act upon that environment with effectors, hopefully in a way that can be perceived by the actual agent. And so what do you think are some examples of these intelligent agents that you’ve seen in your lives recently? I know for me, I have things like Amazon Alexa or smartwatches. Basically, anything that has a sensor and acts upon its own and its environment is going to be in some form of intelligent agent. Now a lot of these are going to be categorized as weak AI, right? So it’s very good at one thing. A simple example is a thermostat, or even a Roomba. Roombas are really good at vacuuming your floor, but not so great at opening your door for you, or cooking your food or telling you what temperature it is in your house.</description></item><item><title>AI Advancements</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/06-ai-advancement/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/06-ai-advancement/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script So let’s take a look at some early attempts of artificial intelligence. So Alan Newell and Herbert Simon were a couple of early researchers in AI. In 1955, they wrote a program designed to mimic the problem solving skills of a human being, and called it the logic theorist. This program is now widely considered to be the first AI program, it was used to prove theorems in the book of Principia Mathematica, and actually created a much more elegant proof for some of the theorems than the author wrote for the book. At the time, interest was swirling around the growing idea of AI, and the experts decided to come together and discuss that topic at length. This is a conference that John McCarthy had wanted and successfully organized. There’s a lot of different types of AI that have been developed over the years. And there’s a lot of different methodologies behind them to make them artificially intelligent. But a lot of this deals with how we represent knowledge and information for the AI. So there’s a ton of information in the world, even something as simple as a smartwatch that’s detecting your heart rate and oxygen levels and things like that. It ends up being a lot of information over the course of a small period. And so how do we represent that knowledge in order for our AI to actually be able to consume it and make good rational decisions from it.</description></item><item><title>AI in Healthcare</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/07-ai-healthcare/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/07-ai-healthcare/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>MarI/O - Machine Learning for Video Games</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/08-mario/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/08-mario/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>IBM's Watson</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/09-ibm-watson/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/09-ibm-watson/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>DeepMind</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/10-deepmind/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/10-deepmind/index.html</guid><description>DeepMind</description></item><item><title>Summary of AI</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/11-summary/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/11-summary/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script So in review, we’ve talked about Alan Turing and the Turing test, along with John Cirillo in Chinese room with the problems and issues that the Turing test actually has. Then, we talked about Newell and Simon’s logic theorist, one of the first AI programs ever to be put out there. Then, we talked a lot about the Dartmouth research projects where organizing the conference to start to kind of build out the idea of AI, and the vast amount of different subtopics, and tools, and projects, and applications of AI, along with things like neural networks with Marvin Minsky, and a bit about the current state of AI. So a lot of things like Deep Blue, AlphaGo, AI in the medical field. So there’s a vast range of different possibilities and applications that we’re currently experiencing, including things like self driving cars. So what’s missing from this discussion, because we could talk for a very long time about AI, and just purely just the applications of AI.</description></item><item><title>The Moral Machine</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/12-moral-machine/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/12-moral-machine/index.html</guid><description>Moral Machine</description></item><item><title>What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | Nick Bostrom</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/13-comp-smarter/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/13-comp-smarter/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence: Crash Course Computer Science #34</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/14-ml-ai-crash-course/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/14-ml-ai-crash-course/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Machine Learning: Living in the Age of AI | A WIRED Film</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/15-ml-wired/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/15-ml-wired/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>AlphaGo - The Movie | Full award-winning documentary</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/16-alpha-go/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/16-alpha-go/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>DeepMind StarCraft II Demonstration</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/17-deepmind-starcraft/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><author>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</author><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/17-deepmind-starcraft/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>AI vs. AI.
