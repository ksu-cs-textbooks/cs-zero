In this video, we’re going to be taking a look at artificial intelligence. But before we get to the artificial part, what is actually intelligence? So what does it mean to be intelligent? This is a question I ask all of my students from the kindergarteners that I do outreach with all the way up into college classes like this, and I get a very wide range of responses here.</description></item><item><title>John McCarthy (1927-2011): Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/03-john-mcarthy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/03-john-mcarthy/</guid><description>Watch through 5:38

And so one of the problems with AI is that it forces the computer to mimic all human behavior, not just intelligence. And so when we start to create an AI for it to truly be human like, right, it has to do all of our own behavior.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Agents</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/05-intelligent-agents/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/05-intelligent-agents/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Differentiation here between strong and weak AI starts to lead to the idea of intelligent agents. Intelligent agents are entities that can perceive things about its environment through sensors and act upon that environment with effectors, hopefully in a way that can be perceived by the actual agent. And so what do you think are some examples of these intelligent agents that you’ve seen in your lives recently?</description></item><item><title>AI Advancements</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/06-ai-advancement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/06-ai-advancement/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script So let’s take a look at some early attempts of artificial intelligence. So Alan Newell and Herbert Simon were a couple of early researchers in AI. In 1955, they wrote a program designed to mimic the problem solving skills of a human being, and called it the logic theorist. This program is now widely considered to be the first AI program, it was used to prove theorems in the book of Principia Mathematica, and actually created a much more elegant proof for some of the theorems than the author wrote for the book.</description></item><item><title>AI in Healthcare</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/07-ai-healthcare/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/07-ai-healthcare/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>MarI/O - Machine Learning for Video Games</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/08-mario/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/08-mario/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>IBM's Watson</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/09-ibm-watson/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/09-ibm-watson/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>DeepMind</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/10-deepmind/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/10-deepmind/</guid><description>DeepMind</description></item><item><title>Summary of AI</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/11-summary/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/11-summary/</guid><description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script So in review, we’ve talked about Alan Turing and the Turing test, along with John Cirillo in Chinese room with the problems and issues that the Turing test actually has. Then, we talked about Newell and Simon’s logic theorist, one of the first AI programs ever to be put out there. Then, we talked a lot about the Dartmouth research projects where organizing the conference to start to kind of build out the idea of AI, and the vast amount of different subtopics, and tools, and projects, and applications of AI, along with things like neural networks with Marvin Minsky, and a bit about the current state of AI.</description></item><item><title>The Moral Machine</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/12-moral-machine/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/12-moral-machine/</guid><description>Moral Machine</description></item><item><title>What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | Nick Bostrom</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/13-comp-smarter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/13-comp-smarter/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence: Crash Course Computer Science #34</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/14-ml-ai-crash-course/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/14-ml-ai-crash-course/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning: Living in the Age of AI | A WIRED Film</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/15-ml-wired/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/15-ml-wired/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>AlphaGo - The Movie | Full award-winning documentary</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/16-alpha-go/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/16-alpha-go/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>DeepMind StarCraft II Demonstration</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/17-deepmind-starcraft/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:27:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/17-deepmind-starcraft/</guid><description> YouTube Video</description></item><item><title>AI vs. AI.
