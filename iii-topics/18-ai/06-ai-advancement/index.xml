So Alan Newell and Herbert Simon were a couple of early researchers in AI. In 1955, they wrote a program designed to mimic the problem solving skills of a human being, and called it the logic theorist. This program is now widely considered to be the first AI program, it was used to prove theorems in the book of Principia Mathematica, and actually created a much more elegant proof for some of the theorems than the author wrote for the book. At the time, interest was swirling around the growing idea of AI, and the experts decided to come together and discuss that topic at length. This is a conference that John McCarthy had wanted and successfully organized. There’s a lot of different types of AI that have been developed over the years. And there’s a lot of different methodologies behind them to make them artificially intelligent. But a lot of this deals with how we represent knowledge and information for the AI. So there’s a ton of information in the world, even something as simple as a smartwatch that’s detecting your heart rate and oxygen levels and things like that. It ends up being a lot of information over the course of a small period. And so how do we represent that knowledge in order for our AI to actually be able to consume it and make good rational decisions from it.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/06-ai-advancement/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
