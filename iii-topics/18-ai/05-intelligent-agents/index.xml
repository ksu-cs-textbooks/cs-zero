Intelligent agents are entities that can perceive things about its environment through sensors and act upon that environment with effectors, hopefully in a way that can be perceived by the actual agent. And so what do you think are some examples of these intelligent agents that you’ve seen in your lives recently? I know for me, I have things like Amazon Alexa or smartwatches. Basically, anything that has a sensor and acts upon its own and its environment is going to be in some form of intelligent agent. Now a lot of these are going to be categorized as weak AI, right? So it’s very good at one thing. A simple example is a thermostat, or even a Roomba. Roombas are really good at vacuuming your floor, but not so great at opening your door for you, or cooking your food or telling you what temperature it is in your house.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><managingEditor>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</managingEditor><webMaster>altcs@ksu.edu (K-State CS Faculty)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cs-zero/iii-topics/18-ai/05-intelligent-agents/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
