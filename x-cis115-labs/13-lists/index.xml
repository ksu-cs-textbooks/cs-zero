      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides The first collection we&amp;rsquo;ll review in Python is the list. A list in Python allows us to store many individual values, or elements, in a single variable. To keep track of the elements, each one is assigned an index, which is an integer that uniquely identifies the element&amp;rsquo;s position in the list. In Python, just like in many other programming languages, the indexes begin at $0$ and count up from there.</description>

      <title>Loops with Lists</title>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides One great way to work with lists in Python is using a loop. Recall from an earlier lab that a for loop actually iterates over a list itself, and that the range() function is simply used to generate a list that the for loop can use. Likewise, while loops can also be used in a similar way.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a quick example of how we can iterate through the items in a list using a loop in Python.</description>

      <title>Lists and Functions</title>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Earlier in this lab, we saw Python Tutor create a list variable within the frame of a function, but that variable actually pointed to a list object that was stored in the global objects list. As it turns out, this seemingly minor distinction is a very important concept to understand how lists and functions interact with each other.
To demonstrate what is going on, let&amp;rsquo;s explore a program that contains multiple functions that operate on lists using Python Tutor once again.</description>

      <title>Slicing Lists</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cs-zero/x-cis115-labs/13-lists/04-slicing-lists/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cs-zero/x-cis115-labs/13-lists/04-slicing-lists/index.html</guid>
      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides One of the coolest features in Python is the ability to easily create slices of lists. A slice is simply a portion of a list that can be stored and used as a separate list, allowing us as programmers to quickly create and manipulate new lists based on existing lists.
There are two basic ways to create a list slice in Python.
nums[start:end] - this will create a slice of the list stored in nums that begins as the index start and ends before the index end.</description>

      <title>Strings are Lists</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cs-zero/x-cis115-labs/13-lists/05-strings-are-lists/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cs-zero/x-cis115-labs/13-lists/05-strings-are-lists/index.html</guid>
      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Throughout this course, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen several different ways to work with strings. In Python, just like in many other programming languages, it is possible to treat strings as a list of individual characters. Because of this, we can write many useful programs that use and manipulate strings in a variety of ways.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at one quick example program that can manipulate strings just like a list!</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s work through another full example program in Python that uses lists and strings, just to gain some more experience with the various ways we can use the techniques we&amp;rsquo;ve learned in this lab.
For this example, consider the following problem statement:
Write a program to construct and print Pascal&amp;rsquo;s Triangle for a given number of rows. The user should be prompted to enter a positive integer indicating the number of rows, and if the user provides an invalid input the program should prompt for additional input until valid input is received.</description>

      <description>In this lab, we introduced several major important topics in Python. Let&amp;rsquo;s quickly review them.
Python Lists Lists in Python allow us to store multiple elements in a single variable, with each element identified by a unique index within the list.
Lists can be created using square brackets []:
list_a = [] list_b = [5, 3, 7]Adding and Accessing List Items New elements can be added to a list using the append() method:</description>
